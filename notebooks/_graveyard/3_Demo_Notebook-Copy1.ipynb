The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti .   The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans .   An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Casting   2 Character history   2.1 Name     3 Death   4 Notes   5 References      Casting ( edit )   During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call .   They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer .   Character history ( edit )   The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 .   The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love .   In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college .   On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby , as seen in the season 4 finale `` The Leap '' , he is seen in front of the classroom of students , one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother . But in the first episode of season 5 , `` Definitions '' , it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom -- Economics instead of Architecture . At the same time in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy ( Rachel Bilson ) , whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate . They see Ted enter the room , but when he announces the subject , The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off . She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom .   Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time .   Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band .   In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar .   In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding .   The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after .   The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey .   In `` Bass Player Wanted '' , the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall , carrying his son Marvin , on her way to Farhampton Inn . On their way , it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band , that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception . But the band 's leader , Darren , forced her to quit . The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band . She ends up alone at the bar , and while practicing a speech to give Darren , Darren walks up to her furious the groom 's best man punched him for `` no reason . '' Amused by this , the Mother laughs , and Darren quits the band in anger .   In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door .   In `` Gary Blauman '' , Ted and the Mother are on their first date . Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish - Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner . On the way there , Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run - in with Louis . She says that she is in the `` weirdest place on earth '' right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating . Ted walks her back to her apartment . They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away . The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her . When the story is over , they say goodnight again . The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time , before deciding to carry on their date .   In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton .   Name ( edit )   The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy .   Death ( edit )  See also : Last Forever  In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' .   A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 .   Notes ( edit )    Jump up ^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that `` Pilot '' is set .

Note that the picture shows several stages of one and the same spermatozoon - only one penetrates the ovum Illustration depicting ovulation and fertilization .  Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century .   The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus .   In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro .

Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell , known as zygote . The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism .   Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane ( edit )   Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical elevation , termed the cone of attraction or reception cone . Once the spermatozoon has entered , the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane , the perivitelline membrane , which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa .   Sperm preparation ( edit )  Further information : Acrosome reaction  At the beginning of the process , the sperm undergoes a series of changes , as freshly ejaculated sperm is unable or poorly able to fertilize . The sperm must undergo capacitation in the female 's reproductive tract over several hours , which increases its motility and destabilizes its membrane , preparing it for the acrosome reaction , the enzymatic penetration of the egg 's tough membrane , the zona pellucida , which surrounds the oocyte .   Zona pellucida ( edit )   After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida , which is an extra-cellular matrix of glycoproteins . A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida . This binding triggers the acrosome to burst , releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida .   Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells . As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 % genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort . It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection .   Recent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process .  Cortical reaction ( edit )  Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs . Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida . This in turn causes the glyco - proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other -- i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f -- making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm . This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm . The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg .   Fusion ( edit )  Fertilization and implantation in humans .  After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg . The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body . The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material .   Cell membranes ( edit )   The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place .   Transformations ( edit )   In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes .   The oocyte completes its second meiotic division . This results in a mature ovum . The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process , to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization .   The sperm 's tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus . This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin . Still , a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring .   Replication ( edit )   The pronuclei migrate toward the center of the oocyte , rapidly replicating their DNA as they do so to prepare the zygote for its first mitotic division .   Mitosis ( edit )   Usually 23 chromosomes from spermatozoon and 23 chromosomes from egg cell fuse ( half of spermatozoons carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome ) . Their membranes dissolve , leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes . During this dissolution , a mitotic spindle forms between them . The spindle captures the chromosomes before they disperse in the egg cytoplasm . Upon subsequently undergoing mitosis ( which includes pulling of chromatids towards centrioles in anaphase ) the cell gathers genetic material from the male and female together . Thus , the first mitosis of the union of sperm and oocyte is the actual fusion of their chromosomes .   Each of the two daughter cells resulting from that mitosis has one replica of each chromatid that was replicated in the previous stage . Thus , they are genetically identical .   Fertilization age ( edit )   Fertilization is the event most commonly used to mark the zero point in descriptions of prenatal development of the embryo or fetus . The resultant age is known as fertilization age , fertilizational age , embryonic age , fetal age or ( intrauterine ) developmental ( IUD ) age .   Gestational age , in contrast , takes the beginning of the last menstrual period ( LMP ) as the zero point . By convention , gestational age is calculated by adding 14 days to fertilization age and vice versa . In fact , however , fertilization usually occurs within a day of ovulation , which , in turn , occurs on average 14.6 days after the beginning of the preceding menstruation ( LMP ) . There is also considerable variability in this interval , with a 95 % prediction interval of the ovulation of 9 to 20 days after menstruation even for an average woman who has a mean LMP - to - ovulation time of 14.6 . In a reference group representing all women , the 95 % prediction interval of the LMP - to - ovulation is 8.2 to 20.5 days .   The average time to birth has been estimated to be 268 days ( 38 weeks and two days ) from ovulation , with a standard deviation of 10 days or coefficient of variation of 3.7 % .   Fertilization age is sometimes used postnatally ( after birth ) as well to estimate various risk factors . For example , it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation .   Diseases ( edit )   Various disorders can arise from defects in the fertilization process .    Polyspermy results from multiple sperm fertilizing an egg .    However , some researchers have found that in rare pairs of fraternal twins , their origin might have been from the fertilization of one egg cell from the mother and eight sperm cells from the father . This possibility has been investigated by computer simulations of the fertilization process .

In the NFL , the quarterback is the only position that is credited with records of wins and losses .   Active quarterback Tom Brady holds the records for most wins with 220 , most regular season wins with 195 , and most postseason wins with 25 , as of Week 16 of the 2017 NFL season . Having played the entirety of his career with the New England Patriots , each of Brady 's win records also apply to wins with a single team .

It was a late 16th - century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America . The colony was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh .   The colonists disappeared during the Anglo - Spanish War , three years after the last shipment of supplies from England . Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname `` The Lost Colony '' .

Sir Humphrey Gilbert 's half - brother Sir Walter Raleigh later gained his brother 's charter from the Queen and subsequently executed the details of the charter through his delegates Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville , Raleigh 's distant cousin .   Raleigh 's charter  A watercolor of the fort in Guyanailla Bay , which is likely similar to the fort constructed on Roanoke  On March 25 , 1584 , Queen Elizabeth I granted Raleigh a charter for the colonization of the area of North America . This charter specified that Raleigh needed to establish a colony in North America , or lose his right to colonization .   The Queen and Raleigh intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World . The queen 's charter said that Raleigh was supposed to `` discover , search , find out , and view such remote heathen and barbarous Lands , Countries , and territories ... to have , hold , occupy , and enjoy '' .   The queen 's charter also said that Raleigh was supposed to establish a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain . The purpose of these raids was to tell Spain that England was ready for war . The original charter basically told Raleigh to establish a military base to counteract the activities of the Spaniards . Raleigh himself never visited North America , although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to South America 's Orinoco River basin in search of the legendary golden city of El Dorado .   First Voyages to Roanoke Island   On April 27 , 1584 , Raleigh dispatched an expedition led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore the eastern coast of North America . They arrived on Roanoke Island on July 4 and soon established relations with the local natives , the Secotans and Croatans . Barlowe returned to England with two Croatans named Manteo and Wanchese , who were able to describe the politics and geography of the area to Raleigh . Based on the information given , Raleigh organized a second expedition , to be led by Sir Richard Grenville .  Sir Walter Raleigh  Grenville 's fleet departed Plymouth on April 9 , 1585 , with five main ships : Tiger ( Grenville 's ) , Roebuck , Red Lion , Elizabeth , and Dorothy . A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated Tiger from the rest of the fleet . The captains had a contingency plan if they were separated , which was to meet up again in Puerto Rico , and Tiger arrived in the `` Baye of Muskito '' ( Guayanilla Bay ) on May 11 .   While waiting for the other ships , Grenville established relations with the resident Spanish while simultaneously engaging in some privateering against them . He also built a fort . Elizabeth arrived soon after the fort 's construction . Grenville eventually tired of waiting for the remaining ships and departed on June 7 . The fort was abandoned , and its location remains unknown .   Tiger sailed through Ocracoke Inlet on June 26 , but it struck a shoal , ruining most of the food supplies . The expedition succeeded in repairing the ship and , in early July , reunited with Roebuck and Dorothy , which had arrived in the Outer Banks with Red Lion some weeks previous . Red Lion had dropped off its passengers and left for Newfoundland for privateering .   In the New World   During the initial exploration of the mainland coast and the native settlements , the Europeans blamed the natives of the village of Aquascogoc for stealing a silver cup . As retaliation , the settlers sacked and burned the village . English writer and courtier Richard Hakluyt 's contemporaneous reports also describe this incident . ( Hakluyt 's reports of the first voyage to Roanoke were compiled from accounts by various financial backers , including Sir Walter Raleigh . Hakluyt himself never traveled to the New World . )   Despite this incident and a lack of food , Grenville decided to leave Ralph Lane and 107 men to establish a colony at the north end of Roanoke Island , promising to return in April 1586 with more men and fresh supplies . The group disembarked on August 17 , 1585 , and built a small fort on the island . There are no surviving renderings of the Roanoke fort , but it was likely similar in structure to the one in Guayanilla Bay . Grenville in the Tiger on only his seventh day of sail captured ( after a three - day battle ) a rich Spanish galleon , Santa Maria de San Vicente off Bermuda which he took with him as a prize back to England .   As April 1586 passed , there was no sign of Grenville 's relief fleet . Meanwhile , in June , bad blood resulted from the destruction of the village , and this spurred an attack on the fort by the local Native Americans , which the colonists were able to repel . Soon after the attack , Sir Francis Drake was on his way home from a successful raid in the Caribbean , and he stopped at the colony and offered to take the colonists back to England . Several accepted , including metallurgist Joachim Gans . On this return voyage , the Roanoke colonists introduced tobacco , maize , and potatoes to England . The relief fleet arrived shortly after Drake 's departure with the colonists . Finding the colony abandoned , Grenville returned to England with the bulk of his force , leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh 's claim to Roanoke Island .   Lost Colony   In 1587 , Raleigh dispatched a new group of 115 colonists to establish a colony on Chesapeake Bay . They were led by John White , an artist and friend of Raleigh who had accompanied the previous expedition to Roanoke , and was appointed governor of the 1587 colony . White and Raleigh named 12 assistants to aid in the settlement . They were ordered to stop at Roanoke to pick up the small contingent left there by Grenville the previous year , but when they arrived on July 22 , 1587 , they found nothing except a skeleton that may have been the remains of one of the English garrison .  Baptism of Virginia Dare , the first English child born in North America . Lithograph , 1880  When they could find no one , the master pilot Simon Fernandez refused to let the colonists return to the ships , insisting that they establish the new colony on Roanoke . His motives remain unclear , however , and new evidence offered by author Brandon Fullam indicates not only that Fernandez had good reason for his actions , but that the decision to alter the Chesapeake Bay destination had already been agreed to prior to their arrival at Roanoke .   White re-established relations with the Croatan and other local tribes , but those with whom Lane had fought previously refused to meet with him . Shortly thereafter , colonist George Howe was killed by a native while searching alone for crabs in Albemarle Sound .   The colonists persuaded Governor White to return to England to explain the colony 's desperate situation and ask for help . Left behind were about 115 colonists -- the remaining men and women who had made the Atlantic crossing plus White 's newly born granddaughter Virginia Dare , the first English child born in the Americas .   White sailed for England in late 1587 , although crossing the Atlantic at that time of year was a considerable risk . Plans for a relief fleet were delayed first by the captain 's refusal to return during the winter , and then the attack on England of the Spanish Armada and the subsequent Anglo - Spanish War . Every able English ship joined the fight , leaving White without a means to return to Roanoke at the time . In the spring of 1588 , White managed to acquire two small vessels and sailed for Roanoke ; however , his attempt to return was thwarted when the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward - bound voyage ( in order to improve their profits ) . They themselves were captured and their cargo seized . With nothing left to deliver to the colonists , the ships returned to England .   Return to the Lost Colony  Further information : Watts ' West Indies and Virginia expedition The discovery of the word `` Croatoan '' carved onto a stockade board  Because of the continuing war with Spain , White was unable to mount another resupply attempt for an additional three years . He finally gained passage on a privateering expedition organised by John Watts and Walter Raleigh . They agreed to stop off at Roanoke on the way back after raiding the Spanish in the Caribbean . White landed on August 18 , 1590 , on his granddaughter 's third birthday , but found the settlement deserted . His men could not find any trace of the 90 men , 17 women , and 11 children , nor was there any sign of a struggle or battle .   The only clue was the word `` CROATOAN '' carved into a post of the fence around the village , and the letters C-R-O carved into a nearby tree . All the houses and fortifications had been dismantled , which meant that their departure had not been hurried . Before he had left the colony , White instructed the colonists that , if anything happened to them , they should carve a Maltese cross on a tree nearby , indicating that their absence had been forced . There was no cross , and White took this to mean that they had moved to Croatoan Island ( now known as Hatteras Island ) , but he was unable to conduct a search . A massive storm was forming and his men refused to go any farther ; the next day , they left .   Thomas Harriot   Born in 1560 , Thomas Harriot entered Raleigh 's employment in the early 1580s , after graduating from the University of Oxford . Harriot may have been among the men of Arthur Barlowe 's 1584 expedition of the colony . He trained the members of Raleigh 's first Roanoke expedition in navigational skills and eventually sailed to Roanoke with the second group of settlers , where his skills as a naturalist became particularly important along with those of painter and settlement leader John White .   Between their arrival in Roanoke in April 1585 and the July 1586 departure , Harriot and White both conducted detailed studies of the Roanoke area , with Harriot compiling his samples and notes into several notebooks that did not survive the colony 's disappearance . Harriot also wrote descriptions of the surrounding flora and fauna of the area , which survive in his work A Brief and True Report of the New Founde Land of Virginia , written as a report on the colony 's progress to the English government on the request of Raleigh . Viewed by modern historians as propaganda for the colony , this work has become vastly important to Roanoke 's history due to Harriot 's observations on wildlife as well as his depictions of Indian activities at the time of the colony 's disappearance .   Harriot reports that relations between the Roanoke Indians and the English settlers were mutually calm and prosperous , contradicting other historical evidence that catalogs the bloody struggles between the Roanoke Indians and both of Raleigh 's commanders , Sir Richard Grenville and his successor , Ralph Lane . Harriot recounts little to none of these accounts in his report to England and does not mention the disorderly state of the colony under either Grenville 's or Lane 's tenure , correctly assuming these facts would prevent Roanoke from gaining more settlers . Harriot 's text did not reach England , or the English press , until 1588 , by which time the fate of the `` Lost Colony '' was sealed in all but name .   Investigations into Roanoke  Reconstructed fortifications at Fort Raleigh National Historic Site  Twelve years went by before Raleigh decided to find out what happened to his colony . Led by Samuel Mace , this 1602 expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors ' wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering . However , Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip , and Mace 's ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic woods or plants such as sassafras that would generate a decent profit back in England . By the time they could turn their attention to the colonists , the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island . By this time , having been arrested for treason , Raleigh was unable to send any further missions .   There was one final expedition in 1603 led by Bartholomew Gilbert with the intention of finding Roanoke colonists . Their intended destination was Chesapeake Bay , but bad weather forced them to land in an unspecified location near there . The landing team , including Gilbert himself , was killed by a group of Native Americans for unknown reasons on July 29 . The remaining crew were forced to return to England empty - handed .   Meanwhile , the Spanish had different reasons for wanting to find the colony . Knowing of Raleigh 's plans to use Roanoke as a base for privateering , they were hoping to destroy it . Moreover , they had been getting mostly inaccurate reports of activities there , and they imagined the colony to be far more successful than it actually was .   In 1590 , they found the remnants of the colony purely by accident , but assumed it was only an outlying base of the main settlement , which they believed was in the Chesapeake Bay area ( John White 's intended location ) . But just as the Anglo - Spanish War prevented White from returning in a timely manner , Spanish authorities in the New World could not muster enough support back home for such a venture .   Reports of John Smith and William Strachey   Once the Jamestown settlement was established in 1607 , efforts were undertaken by the English to acquire information from the Powhatan tribe about Roanoke . The first definitive information concerning the fate of the Lost Colony came from Captain John Smith , leader of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609 . According to chronicler Samuel Purchas , Smith learned from Chief Powhatan that he had personally conducted the slaughter of the Roanoke colonists just prior to the arrival of the Jamestown settlers because they were living with the Chesepians , a tribe living in the eastern portion of the present - day South Hampton Roads sub-region who were related to the Pamlico tribe in Carolina and who refused to merge with the Powhatans . This shocking information was reported to England and by the spring of 1609 , King James and the Royal Council were convinced that Chief Powhatan was responsible for the slaughter of the Lost Colony .   The second source of Chief Powhatan 's involvement was William Strachey , Secretary of the Jamestown colony in 1610 -- 11 . Strachey 's The Historie of Travaile Into Virginia Britannia seemed to confirm Smith 's report and provided additional information : the colonists had been living peacefully among a group of natives beyond Powhatan 's domain for more than twenty years when they were massacred . Furthermore , Powhatan himself seemed to have directed the slaughter because of prophecies by his priests that he would be overthrown by people from that area , and he reportedly produced several English - made iron implements to back his claim .   The information from these two sources , John Smith and William Strachey , provides the basis for the traditional view that the Lost Colony was slaughtered by Chief Powhatan , and versions of the Powhatan - Lost Colony - slaughter scenario have persisted for more than 400 years . However , no bodies were found and no archaeological evidence has been found to support this claim .   Furthermore , recent re-examination of the Smith and Strachey sources advanced by author and researcher Brandon Fullam has suggested that the massacre described by Powhatan was actually of the 15 people left behind by the first Roanoke expedition , leaving the fate of the second colony still unknown .   Hypotheses about the disappearance     Integration with local tribes  The Francis Nelson ( or Zuniga ) map , c. 1607  As per Smith 's and Strachey 's reports , Dr. David Beers Quinn theorized that the colonists moved north to integrate with the Chesepians that Chief Powhatan claimed to have killed . To make the journey northward , Quinn believed that they used the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings . Naturally , if that were the mode of transportation , the colonists could have gone to live in other locations as well .   In her 2000 book Roanoke : Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony , historian Lee Miller postulated that some of the Lost Colony survivors sought shelter with the Chowanoke , who were attacked by another tribe , identified by the Jamestown Colony as the `` Mandoag '' ( an Algonquian name commonly given to enemy nations ) . The Mandoag are believed to be either the Tuscarora , an Iroquois - speaking tribe , or the Eno , also known as the Wainoke .   The so - called `` Zuniga Map '' ( named for Pedro de Zúñiga , the Spanish ambassador to England , who had secured a copy and passed it on to Philip III of Spain ) , drawn about 1607 by the Jamestown settler Francis Nelson , also gives credence to this claim . The map states `` four men clothed that came from roonock '' were living in an Iroquois site on the Neuse . William Strachey wrote that , at the Indian settlements of Peccarecanick and Ochanahoen , there were reportedly two - story houses with stone walls . The Indians supposedly had learned how to build them from the Roanoke settlers . In both cases , as stated above , it is equally possible that these were survivors of Chief Powhatan 's attack on the first Jamestown colonists .   There were also reported sightings of European captives at various Indian settlements during the same time period . Strachey wrote in 1612 that four English men , two boys and one girl had been sighted at the Eno settlement of Ritanoc , under the protection of a chief called Eyanoco . Strachey reported that the captives were forced to beat copper and that they had escaped the attack on the other colonists and fled up the Chaonoke river , the present - day Chowan River in Bertie County , North Carolina .   John Lawson wrote in his 1709 work A New Voyage to Carolina that the Croatans living on Hatteras Island used to live on Roanoke Island and claimed to have white ancestors :   A farther Confirmation of this we have from the Hatteras Indians , who either then lived on Ronoak - Island , or much frequented it . These tell us , that several of their Ancestors were white People , and could talk in a Book , as we do ; the Truth of which is confirm 'd by gray Eyes being found frequently amongst these Indians , and no others . They value themselves extremely for their Affinity to the English , and are ready to do them all friendly Offices . It is probable , that this Settlement miscarry 'd for want of timely Supplies from England ; or thro ' the Treachery of the Natives , for we may reasonably suppose that the English were forced to cohabit with them , for Relief and Conversation ; and that in process of Time , they conform 'd themselves to the Manners of their Indian Relations .   From the early 17th century to the middle 18th century , European colonists reported encounters with gray - eyed American Indians who claimed descent from the colonists ( although at least one , a story of a Welsh priest who met a Doeg warrior who spoke the Welsh language , is likely to be a hoax ) . Records from French Huguenots who settled along the Tar River in 1696 tell of meeting Tuscaroras with blond hair and blue eyes not long after their arrival . As Jamestown was the nearest English settlement , and they had no record of being attacked by Tuscarora , the likelihood that the origin of those fair - skinned natives was the Lost Colony is high .   Fred Willard and Phillip MacMullan believe that the colonists along with the Croatans relocated to villages along the Alligator River in an area known as `` Beechland '' , slightly inland from Roanoke Island . Archeological remains of settlements have been discovered in the area , including coffins with Christian markings on them where there had been no previous record of a grave site , but their hypothesis is mostly based on oral histories and also lacks any definitive evidence .   In the late 1880s , North Carolina state legislator Hamilton McMillan discovered that his `` redbones '' ( those of Indian blood ) neighbors in Robeson County claimed to have been descended from the Roanoke settlers . He also noticed that many of the words in their language had striking similarities to obsolete English words . Furthermore , many of the family names were identical to those listed in Hakluyt 's account of the colony . Thus on February 10 , 1885 , convinced that these were the descendants of the Lost Colony , he helped to pass the `` Croatan bill '' , that officially designated the population around Robeson county as Croatan . Two days later on February 12 , 1885 , the Fayetteville Observer published an article regarding the Robeson people 's origins . This article states :   They say that their traditions say that the people we call the Croatan Indians ( though they do not recognize that name as that of a tribe , but only a village , and that they were Tuscaroras ) , were always friendly to the whites ; and finding them destitute and despairing of ever receiving aid from England , persuaded them to leave ( Roanoke Island ) , and go to the mainland ... They gradually drifted away from their original seats , and at length settled in Robeson , about the center of the county ...   However , the case was far from settled . A similar legend claims that the now extinct Saponi of Person County , North Carolina , are descended from the English colonists of Roanoke Island . However , no documented evidence exists to link the Saponi to the Roanoke colonists .   Other tribes claiming partial descent from surviving Roanoke colonists include the Catawba ( who absorbed the Shakori and Eno people ) , and the Coree and the people who call themselves the Lumbee . Samuel A'Court Ashe was convinced that the colonists had relocated westward to the banks of the Chowan River in Bertie County , and Conway Whittle Sams claimed that after being attacked by Wanchese and Powhatan , the colonists scattered to multiple locations : the Chowan River , and south to the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers .   Other theories  Spanish  Another theory is that the Spanish destroyed the colony . Earlier in the century , the Spanish did destroy evidence of the French colony of Fort Charles in coastal South Carolina and then massacred the inhabitants of Fort Caroline , a French colony near present - day Jacksonville , Florida . However , a Spanish attack is unlikely , as the Spanish were still looking for the location of England 's failed colony as late as 1600 , ten years after White discovered that the colony was missing .  Dare stones Main article : Dare Stones  From 1937 to 1941 , a series of inscribed stones were discovered that were claimed to have been written by Eleanor Dare , mother of Virginia Dare . They told of the travelings of the colonists and their ultimate deaths . Most historians believe that they are a fraud , but there are some today who still believe at least one of the stones to be genuine .  Virginia Pars map  In May 2011 , Brent Lane of the First Colony Foundation was studying the Virginia Pars Map , which was made by John White during his 1585 visit to Roanoke Island , and noticed two patches where the map had been corrected . The patches are made of paper contemporaneous with that of the map . Lane asked researchers at the British Museum in London , where the map has been kept since 1866 , what might be under the patches , sparking a research investigation . On May 3 , 2012 , at Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , members of the Foundation and representatives of the museum announced the discovery of `` a large , square - shaped symbol with oddly shaped corners . '' This symbol , presumed to represent a fort , is visible when the map is viewed on a light box . Some scholars speculate that the colonists relocated to that location , on what is now called Salmon Creek in the Bertie County community of Merry Hill . The Scotch Hall Preserve golf course community was planned on the site , but it has not been fully developed .   The discovery of new information on the map led to more study of artifacts previously found , as well as additional digs in 2012 and 2014 .   Archaeological evidence   In 1993 , Hurricane Emily caused numerous relics to appear , and David Phelps of East Carolina University later began digging in the area and found evidence the settlers lived with the native people .   In 1998 , East Carolina University organized `` The Croatoan Project '' , an archaeological investigation into the events at Roanoke . The excavation team sent to Hatteras Island uncovered what they believed to be a 10 karat ( 42 % ) gold 16th - century English signet ring , gun flints , and two copper farthings ( produced sometime in the 1670s ) at the site of the ancient Croatan capital , 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the old Roanoke Colony . Genealogists were able to trace the lion crest on the signet ring to the Kendall coat of arms , and concluded that the ring most likely belonged to one Master Kendall who is recorded as having lived in the Roanoke Colony from 1585 to 1586 . If this is the case , the ring represents the first material connection between the Roanoke colonists and the Native Americans on Hatteras Island . However , archaeologist David Phelps did not have the ring tested , and Charles Ewen , who continued Phelps ' work after Phelps retired , had the ring tested and found the ring was brass . Ewen announced his findings in April 2017 . Mark Horton of the University of Bristol said he was not convinced that this news proved the ring did not date to the 16th century .   It is also believed that the reason for the extreme deficiency in archaeological evidence is due to shoreline erosion . Since all that was found was a rustic looking fort on the north shore , and this location is well - documented and backed up , it is believed that the settlement must have been nearby . The northern shore , between 1851 and 1970 , lost 928 feet ( 283 m ) because of erosion . If in the years leading up to and following the brief life of the settlement at Roanoke , shoreline erosion was following the same trend , it is likely the site of the dwellings is underwater , along with any artifacts or signs of life . Archaeological investigations continue to find tantalizing clues and funding is being sought to continue recent excavations .   Climate factors   In 1998 , a team led by climatologist David W. Stahle , of the University of Arkansas and archaeologist Dennis B. Blanton of the College of William and Mary used tree ring cores from 800 - year - old bald cypresses taken from the Roanoke Island area of North Carolina and the Jamestown area of Virginia to reconstruct precipitation and temperature chronologies .   The researchers concluded that the settlers of the Lost Colony landed at Roanoke Island in the summer of the worst growing - season drought in 800 years . `` This drought persisted for 3 years , from 1587 to 1589 , and is the driest 3 - year episode in the entire 800 - year reconstruction , '' the team reported in the journal Science . A map shows that `` the Lost Colony drought affected the entire southeastern United States but was particularly severe in the Tidewater region near Roanoke ( Island ) . '' The authors suggested that the Croatan who were shot and killed by the colonists may have been scavenging the abandoned village for food as a result of the drought .   Lost Colony of Roanoke DNA Project   The Lost Colony of Roanoke DNA Project was founded in 2007 by a group led by Roberta Estes , who owns a private DNA - testing company , in order to solve the mystery of the Lost Colony using historical records , migration patterns , oral histories and DNA testing . The project used Y chromosome , Mitochondrial DNA and Autosomal DNA . As of 2016 , they have not yet been able to positively identify any descendants of the colony .

Comics    Marvel 1602 , a 2003 comic book series , provides an alternate timeline in which the Roanoke Colony thrived and places many Marvel characters , such as Steve Rogers in this situation .     Marvel Comics Presents , an American comic book anthology series published by Marvel Comics , included a story in which the responsible of the disappearance of the Roanoke Colony was a Vinland viking settler turned into a vampire circa AD 1000 .    Film    The dramatic feature , The Legend of Two Path ( 1998 ) , recounts the arrival of the English settlers from the viewpoint of the Native Americans of Roanoke Island in 1584 .   2004 crime thriller Mindhunters is about someone who goes missing from a group of FBI trainees , only to be found in the Lost Colony after leaving the word ' Croatoan ' behind as a clue .

In this adaptation , the Horseman of Pestilence supposedly visited Roanoke Island and infected its inhabitants with plague . Virginia Dare became a ghost and led her fellow settlers to Upstate New York where they continue to haunt to this day .   American Horror Story : Roanoke , which came out in 2016 , is the sixth season of American Horror Story , features the colonists from real life as spirits that haunt North Carolina due to a deal that John White 's wife made with a witch .

West Africa is the portion roughly west of 10 ° east longitude , excluding Northern Africa and the Maghreb . West Africa contains large portions of the Sahara Desert and the Adamawa Mountains .   East Africa stretches from the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa to Mozambique , including Madagascar   Central Africa is the large mass at the center of Africa which either does not fall squarely into any other region or only partially does so .   Southern Africa consists of the portion generally south of - 10 ° latitude and the great rainforests of Congo .    This approach is taken , for example , in the United Nations geoscheme for Africa and the regions of the African Union .   Physiographic approach ( edit )  Satellite image of Africa , showing the ecological break that defines the sub-Saharan area  Another common approach divides Africa by using features such as landforms , climatic regions , or vegetation types :    Nile Valley   Nile Delta   Atlas Mountains   Nubia ( Lower Nubia )   The Sahara Desert is the massive but largely empty region in North Africa that contains the world 's largest hot deserts   The Maghreb is a region of northwest Africa encompassing the coastlands and Atlas Mountains of Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia .   The Sahel region covers a belt of grasslands south of the Sahara stretching from Senegal to Sudan .   The Sudan region lies just below the Sahel but is slightly more humid and arable .   Sudanian Savanna   The Horn of Africa is a peninsula in East Africa that juts for hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea , and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden . It encompasses Ethiopia , Eritrea , Somalia and Djibouti .   Ethiopian Highlands ( Roof of Africa )   Sub-Saharan Africa is the area of the African continent which lies south of the Sahara .   The Guinea region is distinguished from the neighboring Sudan region by its rainforests and runs along the Atlantic coast from Guinea to Nigeria .   Sudan ( region )   Negroland   Rhodesia ( region ) ( Northern Rhodesia , Southern Rhodesia )   Mayombe   The Congo Basin is the rainforest region   The Chad Basin The Chad Basin is the largest endorheic drainage basin in Africa , centered on Lake Chad .   East African Rift . The region contains Tanzania , Kenya , Uganda .   Eastern Rift mountains   Rift Valley Lakes   African Great Lakes   Swahili Coast   Pepper Coast   Gold Coast   Slave Coast   Ivory Coast   Barbary Coast   Mittelafrika   Igboland ( Mbaise )   Maputaland    Linguistic approach ( edit )  Map showing the traditional language families represented in Africa : Afroasiatic ( Semitic - Hamitic ) Austronesian ( Malay - Polynesian ) Indo - European Khoisan Niger - Congo : Bantu Central and Eastern Sudanese Central Bantoid Eastern Bantoid Guinean Mande Western Bantoid Nilo - Saharan : Kanuri Nilotic Songhai Main article : Languages of Africa  By official language ( edit )  Official languages in Africa    Afrikaans   Portuguese     Arabic   Spanish     English   Swahili     French   other languages      Anglophone Africa includes five countries in West Africa ( The Gambia , Sierra Leone , Liberia , Ghana , and the most populous African country Nigeria , as well as a part of Cameroon ) that are separated by Francophone countries , South Sudan , and a large continuous area in Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes .   Arabophone Africa includes the four most populous Arabic - speaking countries ( Egypt , Sudan , Morocco , Algeria ) as well as Tunisia , Mauritania and Chad , and includes a majority of both the population and the area of the Arabic - speaking countries . French has also kept a strong role in the Maghreb countries , though this has receded somewhat with official Arabization .   Francophone Africa is a continuous area in West Africa and Central Africa , plus Madagascar and Djibouti .   Lusophone Africa consists of the widely separated countries of Cabo Verde , Guinea - Bissau , Sao Tome and Principe , Angola , and Mozambique .   Equatorial Guinea is the only African country where the Spanish language is official , though French and more recently Portuguese have also been added as official languages .   Swahili is widely used as an inter language in East Africa ; its use for official and educational functions is greatest in Tanzania .   Ethiopia and Somalia use the Afro - Asiatic Amharic and Somali languages , respectively , as their official languages , although Arabic also serves as a secondary language in Somalia . Eritrea and parts of Ethiopia use the Tigrinya language and Arabic language as working languages .    By indigenous language family ( edit )    Niger -- Congo languages and Nilo - Saharan languages are spoken in most of Sub-Saharan Africa . Nilo - Saharan occupies a smaller area but is highly diverse , and may be related as a parent or sibling of Niger -- Congo .   Afro - Asiatic languages are spoken in North Africa , the Horn of Africa , as well as parts of the Sahel .   Khoisan languages are spoken in desert areas of Southern Africa , but were formerly spoken over a larger area , and are thought to include two small languages ( Hadza and Sandawe ) in the African Great Lakes .   Austronesian languages originating from Southeast Asia are spoken in Madagascar .    Investment approach ( edit )  Investment divisions of Africa . Source : RisCura  A slightly less common , but equally important method of division of the continent is by investment factors . For the purposes of investing , Africa is not a single destination with a single set of standardized risk factors and homogeneous potential for reward . Although some high - level similarities are evident , digging into the specifics of certain regions and countries shows that Africa comprises a range of distinct investment destinations , each with its own attractions , flaws , cultural differences and business practices .   The investment approach was first developed by global , independent financial analytics provider and investment consultant , RisCura .    Maghreb region   Otherwise known as the western portion of Northern Africa , these countries form the Arab Maghreb Union , established in 1989 . The region was established with the goal of functioning as a unified political and economic grouping . Political unrest in the region has stunted progress since its inception but hope still remains that the Union will fulfill its purpose in years to come . Algeria , Libya , Mauritania , Morocco and Tunisia are included in this region .     Egypt and Sudan   Previously united under British rule , these countries still share strong ties , as well as one significant commonality -- the trade facilitation through transport on the Nile River . As Egypt does not fall within the Arab Maghreb Union , it is separated from the rest of North Africa . However , Egypt 's strong economic and cultural ties with the Middle East bring natural trading partners , and it is often seen grouped with the Middle East for investment purposes .     Francophone West Africa   This is a commonly recognized region on the continent , and typically includes Mauritania . However , Mauritania is sometimes allocated to the Maghreb region as it is found to have closer ties to the North African countries . These French - speaking countries share more than just a language . Due to their common history as French colonies , they also share similar legal and socio - political systems . The countries in this group are Benin , Burkina Faso , Cape Verde , Côte d'Ivoire , Guinea , Mali , Niger , São Tomé and Príncipe , Senegal and Togo .     Nigeria   On its own , Nigeria is the size of the entire Maghreb region on an aggregated - GDP basis . While Nigeria is traditionally grouped with the rest of West Africa , its reliance on the rest of the region is less pronounced , likely as a result of its massive standalone GDP , its access to international markets via its six large ports , and its population of over 170 million people .     East Africa   This is a combination of the East African Community ( Kenya , Tanzania , Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) , the LAPSSET corridor ( Kenya , South Sudan and Ethiopia ) as well as Djibouti , a crucial link to the Indian Ocean for Ethiopia and South Sudan . Kenya has traditionally headlined this region through consistently generating the largest GDP and acts as the primary route to international trade through the Mombasa port .     Central Africa   This market is the same as that defined by the African Development Bank with the exception of Madagascar , which here is classified as Southern Africa ( ex-SA ) . On a GDP basis ( USD ) and by population , the Central Africa region is on par with the Francophone West African region . Countries included here are Cameroon , Central African Republic , Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo , as well as Equatorial Guinea and Gabon .     Southern Africa excluding South Africa ( ex-SA )   This incorporates countries south of central and eastern Africa , and north of the South African border . The region has support from the most developed economy on the continent from the south , and access to capital coming out of South Africa as large companies look to expand into the rest of the continent . The group comprises Angola ( which offers substantial oil resources ) , Botswana , Comoros , Madagascar , Malawi , Mauritius , Mozambique , Namibia , Reunion , Zambia ( substantial supply of copper ) and Zimbabwe .     South Africa   Like Nigeria , South Africa is a large African economy on a standalone basis . Due to the developed nature of South Africa relative to the rest of the continent , it has not been included in the Southern African region . South Africa boasts the largest GDP per capita of all the regions ( double that of Nigeria ) and is the most advanced investment destination on the continent . The South African market includes Lesotho and Swaziland due to their reliance and proximity to SA . The Swazi lilangeni is pegged to the South African rand , which is also accepted as currency within the country .     Other West Africa   This region includes Ghana , Liberia , Sierra Leone , Guinea - Bissau and The Gambia .

She was trained at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris and has appeared in such films as Loup ( 2009 ) , Sleepless Night ( 2011 ) and Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) . She plays the role of Mantis in the film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Early life   2 Career   3 Filmography   4 See also   5 References   6 External links      Early life ( edit )   Pom Klementieff was born in Quebec City , Quebec , Canada , to a Korean mother and French - Russian father , who was working there as a consul with the French government . She had a brother who committed suicide . Her parents chose the name `` Pom '' because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both `` spring '' ( 봄 ) and `` tiger '' ( 범 ) . Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family traveled extensively due to her father 's job , and she lived in Japan and the Ivory Coast before settling in France . Klementieff later said that travelling at an early age gave her a `` gypsy soul '' .   Klementieff 's father died of cancer when she was 5 , and her mother was schizophrenic and unable to care for children , so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt . Her uncle , whom she described as `` like my second father '' , died on her 18th birthday . Klementieff briefly attended law school after her uncle 's death to appease her aunt , but did not find the career path appealing . She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France . She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris . A few months into her education , she won a theater competition that awarded her free classes for two years with the school 's top teachers .   Career ( edit )  Klementieff in 2018  Klementieff 's first professional acting job was the French independent film Après lui ( 2007 ) , portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve . Filming for her scenes took three days . During one scene , Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself , and director Gaël Morel kept that shot in the final film . Her first leading role was in Loup ( 2009 ) , a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains . During filming , Klementieff stayed in a camp , hours from the nearest village , where temperatures dropped well below zero . During filming she befriended nomads who lived there , worked with real wolves , rode reindeer , and swam with a horse in a lake .   Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee 's Oldboy ( 2013 ) , a remake of the South Korean film of the same name . She portrayed Haeng - Bok , the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley . A fan of the original film , Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee , a producer with the remake , and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts . After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition , Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make - up , like her character in the film . She contributed some of her own clothes to the character 's wardrobe , and trained three hours a day for two months for an on - screen fight with star Josh Brolin . Klementieff came up with the name Haeng - Bok , Korean for `` happiness '' , herself after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character .   Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions . She continued taekwondo after the film , and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014 . Her next acting role was the film Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) , in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film , and due to the movie 's low budget , she had to do her own make - up and chose her own wardrobe . It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role , to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced . She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe with her role as Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) .

After several suggestions of what to call their snowman ( including `` Oatmeal '' and `` Christopher Columbus '' ) , Karen decides to name him `` Frosty . '' Later , the children acquire a top hat discarded by inept magician Professor Hinkle . Karen places the hat on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman comes to life ( and always says `` Happy Birthday ! '' in response ) . When Hinkle learns of the magic power his hat actually possesses , he takes it back and departs , pretending that he did not see Frosty come to life . However , the professor 's pet rabbit , Hocus Pocus , returns the hat to Frosty and the children .   Frosty soon senses the temperature is rising and worries about melting away . The children suggest putting him on the next train to the North Pole , where he will never melt , and they all parade into the city on the way to the train station , where Frosty has his confrontation with the traffic cop mentioned in the song 's lyrics . When Karen explains that Frosty came to life and does n't know what a traffic light or a lamp post is , the traffic cop lets Frosty go . At the train station , Frosty stows away aboard a refrigerated train car , since neither he nor the children have any money for a train ticket . As the train is about to leave the station , Karen and Hocus decide to join Frosty for the ride to keep him company . With that , Frosty , Karen , and Hocus wave goodbye to the other kids as the train takes off . Unbeknownst to them , Hinkle has also hitched a ride on the train , intending to get his hat back .   As the train continues up north , however , Frosty notices Karen is freezing and starting to catch a cold , so they jump off the train , leaving Hinkle behind once again . Hinkle , seeing them escape , jumps off the train too , but falls down a mountain and crashes into a tree where a pile of snow falls on him . At Frosty 's request , Hocus convinces some forest animals who are preparing for Christmas to build a campfire for Karen . Fearing that Karen still can not survive for long in the cold weather , Frosty asks Hocus who might be able to help them . Hocus suggests ( by pantomiming ) the President of the United States and the United States Marines , before suggesting Santa Claus . Frosty agrees , and promptly takes credit for the idea himself ( much to Hocus ' annoyance ) . Hocus hops off to get Santa , but Hinkle then confronts Frosty and Karen once more and blows out Karen 's campfire . Frosty and Karen are again forced to flee , this time with Karen riding on Frosty 's back as he slides head - first down a hill . At the bottom of the slope , Karen and Frosty discover a greenhouse filled with Christmas poinsettias . Despite Karen 's objections , Frosty steps inside the warm greenhouse with her , suggesting that he could afford to lose a little weight while she warms up . Unfortunately , an angry and vengeful Hinkle catches up to them immediately after and locks them in the greenhouse .   Hocus brings Santa Claus to the greenhouse only to find Karen in tears and Frosty melted on the floor due to Hinkle 's cruel act . Santa explains to Karen that Frosty is made from Christmas snow , and that he can never completely disappear , only take the form of summer rain , until next December . With a gust of cold wind through the open greenhouse door , the puddle that was Frosty blows out the door and magically changes back into his typical snowman form . Before Santa can put the finishing touch on Frosty and bring him back to life , as Hocus arrives with the hat , Hinkle arrives on the scene and again demands the return of his hat . He relents only when threatened with being removed from Santa 's Christmas list for the rest of his life if he put so much as one finger on the hat . Santa states that if Hinkle is truly repentant for his mean attitude and harming Frosty , and if he goes home and writes `` I am really sorry for what I did to Frosty '' a hundred zillion times , he may find a gift in his stocking on Christmas morning , which makes Hinkle bid Frosty and Karen farewell and run home to repeatedly write his apologies , assuming he may get a new hat . Finally , Santa then places the magic hat back on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman returns to life again . After celebrating , Santa takes Karen home and Frosty to the North Pole , but promises that Frosty will be back next winter .   The end credits show all the characters the next Christmas marching through the town square with Frosty in the lead , singing the `` Frosty the Snowman '' song . Among them is a redeemed Professor Hinkle , who is proudly wearing his new top hat . At the end of the parade , Frosty gets back into Santa 's waiting sleigh and they return to the North Pole , with Frosty proclaiming , `` I 'll be back on Christmas Day !

The CBC holds broadcast rights in Canada . The special also airs on Freeform in some territories . However , CBS does not own the telecast rights to the 1976 sequel Frosty 's Winter Wonderland ( that special currently airs on Freeform 's 25 Days of Christmas each year ) , which prompted CBS to produce its own `` sequel '' of sorts , Frosty Returns ( see below ) .   Home Media ( edit )   VHS and LaserDisc ( edit )   Family Home Entertainment released Frosty the Snowman on VHS as part of the Christmas Classics Series in 1989 and 1993 , with multiple re-prints throughout the 1990s . It was paired with The Little Drummer Boy on LaserDisc in 1992 . Upon its 1989 and 1993 releases , the special was also bundled in box sets with the other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , the 1973 Chuck Jones holiday special , A Very Merry Cricket and the sequel Frosty Returns which aired on CBS in 1992 . In 1998 , Sony Wonder and Golden Books Family Entertainment released the special on VHS , and also paired it with these other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Cricket on the Hearth in the separate Holiday Classics Collection box sets .   DVD and Blu - ray ( edit )   The special was also released on DVD by Sony Wonder and Classic Media in 2002 and 2004 , and by Genius Entertainment in 2007 . Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment released it on DVD and Blu - ray on October 12 , 2010 , and on the DVD / Blu - ray combo pack on November 6 , 2012 . Most DVD releases also include Frosty Returns . On September 8 , 2015 , Classic Media released both the special and Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town in their 45th Anniversary Collector 's Edition on Blu - ray and DVD in addition to the 50th Anniversary release of Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer in 2014 .   Sequels ( edit )   Frosty returned in several sequels :    Frosty 's Winter Wonderland -- This 1976 sequel by Rankin / Bass was also written by Romeo Muller . Narration is provided by Andy Griffith ( Durante had suffered a stroke that had forced his retirement in 1972 and eventually killed him ) . Jackie Vernon once again reprised his role as the voice of Frosty . Animation is produced by Topcraft in Japan . Unlike the original , the sequel takes place later in the winter season and is based upon the 1934 song `` Winter Wonderland ; '' it features Frosty 's pursuit of a wife and efforts to preserve him into the springtime . Furthermore , it makes no mention whatsoever of Christmas ; in fact it could be considered more a `` winter solstice '' special than a Christmas special as it celebrates the season of winter .   Rudolph and Frosty 's Christmas in July -- This 1979 Rankin / Bass feature - length sequel was filmed in `` Animagic '' stop - motion animation in the style of Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer and Rudolph 's Shiny New Year . While the Frosty specials were 30 minutes long , and the Rudolph specials were 60 minutes , this ambitious special was feature length , at 97 minutes long ( 120 minutes on television , including commercials ) . Vernon once again played the role of Frosty , in his last time for Rankin / Bass playing the voice of Frosty . This film features Frosty and his family as supporting characters . This is the only other Frosty cartoon to mention Christmas or Santa Claus in addition to the 1969 original .   Frosty Returns -- This 1992 half - hour special is not truly a sequel to the 1969 classic , as it was produced not by Rankin / Bass but by CBS . The characters , setting , voices and animation ( by Bill Melendez ) are vastly different . Despite this , it is shown with the original special every year on CBS and was even included as a bonus on its DVD release . John Goodman provides the voice of Frosty in this special , and Jonathan Winters serves as narrator . Frosty 's appearance is physically different , his personality and humor have changed , and he has the ability to live without his top hat , in direct contrast with the original and its other sequels . Also in contrast to the original specials , the special avoids all mention of Christmas ( despite the special portraying the beginning of winter ) and has an environmentalist theme , as Frosty works to stop a corporate executive whose product wipes out snow packs with one spray .   The Legend of Frosty the Snowman -- This 2005 straight - to - video film was produced by Classic Media , the previous rights holder for the original Rankin / Bass special , and the remainder of their pre-1974 library . This movie has been bundled with the original 1969 Rankin / Bass special and the CBS sequel , and has also aired on Cartoon Network . The appearance of Frosty resembles much more the Rankin / Bass character design from their original animation , and Professor Hinkle returns in two cameo appearances -- shown in a picture and flashback . Frosty is voiced by Bill Fagerbakke , best known as the voice of Patrick Star on SpongeBob SquarePants . And it , like Frosty Returns and Frosty 's Winter Wonderland , also never mentions anything to do with Christmas whatsoever .    References ( edit )    Jump up ^ TV Guide Guide to TV .

Acadian flag  The Acadians ( French : Acadiens ) are the descendants of the French settlers , and sometimes the Indigenous peoples , of parts of Acadia ( French : Acadie ) in the northeastern region of North America comprising what is now the Canadian Maritime Provinces of New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and Prince Edward Island , Gaspé , in Quebec , and to the Kennebec River in southern Maine .   The history of the Acadians was significantly influenced by the six colonial wars that took place in Acadia during the 17th and 18th century ( see the four French and Indian Wars , Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) . Eventually , the last of the colonial wars -- the French and Indian War -- resulted in the British Expulsion of the Acadians from the region . After the war , many Acadians came out of hiding or returned to Acadia from the British Colonies . Others remained in France and some migrated from there to Louisiana , where they became known as Cajuns , a corruption of the word Acadiens or Acadians . The nineteenth century saw the beginning of the Acadian Renaissance and the publication of Evangeline , which helped galvanize Acadian identity . In the last century Acadians have made achievements in the areas of equal language and cultural rights as a minority group in the Maritime provinces of Canada .

The trading monopoly of de Monts was cancelled in 1607 , and most of the French settlers returned to France , although some remained with the natives . Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint - Just led a second expedition to Port Royal in 1610 .   Arrival of the first European families ( edit )   The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region . In the early years of Acadian settlement , this included a small number of recorded marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women . Some records have survived showing marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women in formal Roman Catholic rites , for example , the marriage of Charles La Tour to a Mi'kmaw woman in 1626 . There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites , and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities . Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Françoise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 .   Governor Isaac de Razilly 's administration at LaHave , Nova Scotia , prepared the ground for the arrival of the first recorded migrant families on board the Saint Jehan , which left La Rochelle on 1 April 1636 . There were a number of sailings from the French Atlantic Coast to Acadia between 1632 and 1636 , but this is the only one for which a detailed passenger list has survived . Nicolas Denys , who was stationed across the LaHave River at Port Rossingol ( Liverpool Bay ) , acted as agent for the Saint Jehan . After a 35 - day crossing of the Atlantic , the Saint Jehan arrived on 6 May 1636 at LaHave , Nova Scotia . There were seventy - eight passengers and eighteen crew members . With this ship , Acadia began a slow shift from being primarily a matter of explorers and traders , of men , to a colony of permanent settlers , including women and children . While the presence of European women is a signal that settlement was seriously contemplated , there were yet so few of them in this group of migrants that they did not immediately affect the status of Acadia as basically a colony of European transients . By the end of the year , the migrants were moved from LaHave and re-established at Port Royal . At Port Royal in 1636 , Pierre Martin and Catherine Vigneau , who had arrived on the Saint Jehan , were the first European parents to have a child in Acadia . The first - born child was Mathieu Martin . In part because of this distinction , Mathieu Martin later became the Seigneury of Cobequid ( 1699 ) .   Kennedy ( 2014 ) argues that the emigrants from the Vienne region of France carried to Acadia their customs and social structure . They were frontier people , who dispersed their settlements based on kinship . They optimized use of farmland and emphasized trading for a profit . They were hierarchical and politically active . The French and the Acadian villages were similar in terms of prosperity , egalitarianism , and independent - mindedness . Kennedy says the emergence of a distinct Acadian identity emerged from the gradual adaptation of traditional French methods , institutions , and ideas to the North American environmental and political situations .   Civil War ( edit )  Siege of St. John ( 1645 ) - d'Aulnay defeats La Tour in Acadia Main article : Acadian Civil War  With the death of Isaac de Razilly , Acadia was plunged into what some historians have described as a civil war ( 1640 -- 1645 ) . Acadia had two legitimate Lieutenant Governors . The war was between Port Royal , where Governor Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay was stationed , and present - day Saint John , New Brunswick , where Governor Charles de Saint - Étienne de la Tour was stationed .   In the war , there were four major battles . La Tour attacked d'Aulnay at Port Royal in 1640 . In response to the attack , D'Aulnay sailed out of Port Royal to establish a five - month blockade of La Tour 's fort at Saint John , which La Tour eventually defeated ( 1643 ) . La Tour attacked d'Aulnay again at Port Royal in 1643 . D'Aulnay and Port Royal ultimately won the war against La Tour with the 1645 siege of Saint John . After d'Aulnay died ( 1650 ) , La Tour re-established himself in Acadia .   English colony ( 1654 -- 1667 ) ( edit )   In 1654 , war between France and England broke out . Led by Major Robert Sedgwick , a flotilla from Boston , under orders from Cromwell , arrived in Acadia to chase the French out . The flotilla seized La Tour 's fort , then Port - Royal . La Tour , nevertheless , managed to find himself in England , where , with the support of John Kirke , succeeded in receiving from Cromwell a part of Acadia , along with Sir Thomas Temple . La Tour returned to Cap - de-Sable where he remained until his death in 1666 at the age of 70 .   During the English occupation of Acadia , Jean - Baptiste Colbert , Louis XIV 's minister , forbade the Acadians from returning to France . As a result of the English occupation , no new French families settled in Acadia between 1654 and 1670 .   Post Treaty of Breda ( edit )  Marker commemorating the Dutch conquest of Acadia ( 1674 ) , which they renamed New Holland . This is the spot where Jurriaen Aernoutsz buried a bottle at the capital of Acadia , Fort Pentagouet , Castine , Maine .  The Treaty of Breda , signed 31 July 1667 , returned Acadia to France . A year later , Marillon du Bourg arrived to take possession of the territory for France . The son of LeBorgne , Alexandre LeBorgne , was named provisionary governor and lieutenant - general of Acadia . He married Marie Motin - La Tour , the eldest child of the marriage between La Tour and d'Aulnay's widow .   In 1670 , the new governor of Acadia , the chevalier Hubert d'Andigny , chevalier de Grandfontaine , was responsible for the first census undertaken in Acadia . The results did not include those Acadians living with local First Nations . It revealed that there were approximately sixty Acadian families with approximately 300 inhabitants in total . These inhabitants were predominantly engaged in aboiteau farming along the shores of the present day Bay of Fundy . No serious attempt was made to increase the population of Acadia .   In the spring of 1671 , more than fifty colonists left La Rochelle aboard the l'Oranger . Others arrived from Canada ( New France ) or were retired soldiers . During this time , a number of colonists married with the local First Nations . Some of the first to marry were Charles de Saint - Étienne de La Tour , Martin , Pierré Lejeune -- Briard , Jehan Lambert , Petitpas and Guidry . The capitan , Vincent de Saint - Castin , the commander at Pentagoet , married Marie Pidikiwamiska , the daughter of an Abenakis chief .   In 1674 , the Dutch briefly conquered Acadia , renaming the colony New Holland .   During the last decades of the seventeenth century , Acadians migrated from the capital , Port Royal , and established what would become the other major Acadian settlements before the Expulsion of the Acadians : Grand Pré , Chignecto , Cobequid and Pisiguit . Although not common , on occasion epidemics ravished the population of Ile St. - Jean , Ile Royale and Acadia . In 1732 / 33 more than 150 people died of smallpox on Ile Royale .   The history of the settlers of Ile St. - Jean prior to the expulsion includes extreme hardship . For almost every good harvest year it seems that there was one in which crops failed . In one or two instances widespread fires destroyed crops , livestock and farms . Famine and starvation were common and frequently occasioned desperate pleas for supplies from Louisbourg , Québec and even France itself . In 1756 , famine on Ile St. - Jean prompted authorities to relocate some families to Québec .   Prior to the founding of Halifax ( 1749 ) , Port Royal / Annapolis Royal was the capital of Acadia and later Nova Scotia for most of the previous 150 years . During that time the British made six attempts to conquer Acadia by defeating the capital . They finally defeated the French in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1710 ) . Over the following fifty years , the French and their allies made six unsuccessful military attempts to regain the capital .   Colonial wars ( edit )  Acadians at Annapolis Royal by Samuel Scott , 1751 ; earliest known image of Acadians Main article : Military history of the Acadians  There was already a long history of Acadian and Wabanaki Confederacy resistance to the British occupation of Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars and two local wars ( Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) before the Expulsion of the Acadians . The Mi'kmaq and the Acadians were allies through Catholicism and through numerous inter-marriages . The Mi'kmaq held the military strength in Acadia even after the conquest of 1710 . They primarily resisted the British occupation of Acadia and were joined in their efforts on numerous occasions by Acadians .   While many Acadians traded with the New England Protestants , Acadians ' participation in the wars clearly indicated that many were reluctant to be ruled by the British . During the first colonial war , King William 's War ( 1688 -- 97 ) , the crews of the very successful French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste were primarily Acadian . The Acadians resisted during the Raid on Chignecto ( 1696 ) . During Queen Anne 's War , Mi'kmaq and Acadians resisted during the Raid on Grand Pré , Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704 . The Acadians also assisted the French in protecting the capital in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1707 ) and the final Conquest of Acadia . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq were also successful in the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) .  Acadians by Samuel Scott , Annapolis Royal , 1751  During Father Rale 's War , the Maliseet raided numerous vessels on the Bay of Fundy while the Mi'kmaq engaged in the Raid on Canso , Nova Scotia ( 1723 ) . In the latter engagement , the Mi'kmaq were aided by Acadians . During King George 's War , Abbe Jean - Louis Le Loutre led many efforts which involved both Acadians and Mi'kmaq to recapture the capital such as the Siege of Annapolis Royal ( 1744 ) . During this siege , French officer Marin had taken British prisoners and stopped with them further up the bay at Cobequid . While at Cobequid , an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have `` left their ( the English ) carcasses behind and brought their skins '' . Le Loutre was also joined by prominent Acadian resistance leader Joseph Broussard ( Beausoleil ) . Broussard and other Acadians were involved in supporting the French soldiers in the Battle of Grand Pré .   During Father Le Loutre 's War , the conflict continued . The Mi'kmaq attacked New England Rangers in the Siege of Grand Pré and Battle at St. Croix . Upon the founding of Dartmouth , Nova Scotia , Broussard and the Mi'kmaq conducted numerous raids on the village , such as the Raid on Dartmouth ( 1751 ) , to try to stop the Protestant migration into Nova Scotia . ( Similarly , during the French and Indian War , Mi'kmaq , Acadians and Maliseet also engaged in numerous raids on Lunenburg , Nova Scotia , to stop the migration , such as the Raid on Lunenburg ( 1756 ) . ) Le Loutre and Broussard also worked together to resist the British occupation of Chignecto ( 1750 ) and then later they fought together with Acadians in the Battle of Beausejour ( 1755 ) . ( As early as the summer of 1751 , La Valiere reported , approximately 250 Acadians had already enrolled in the local militia at Fort Beausejour . )   When Charles Lawrence took over the post following Hopson 's return to England , he took a stronger stance . He was not only a government official but a military leader for the region . Lawrence came up with a military solution for the forty - five years of an unsettled British conquest of Acadia . The French and Indian War ( and Seven Years ' War in Europe ) began in 1754 . Lawrence 's primary objectives in Acadia were to defeat the French fortifications at Beausejour and Louisbourg . The British saw many Acadians as a military threat in their allegiance to the French and Mi'kmaq . The British also wanted to interrupt the Acadian supply lines to Fortress Louisbourg , which , in turn , supplied the Mi'kmaq .   French and Indian War ( edit )  Main article : Great Upheaval St. John River Campaign : Raid on Grimrose ( present day Gagetown , New Brunswick ) . This is the only contemporaneous image of the Expulsion of the Acadians .  The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710 . Over the next forty - five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain . During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour . During the French and Indian War , the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia .   Many Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better , while other Acadians did not sign because they were clearly anti-British . For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath , there were numerous reasons why they did not . The difficulty was partly religious , in that the British monarch was the head of the ( Protestant ) Church of England . Another significant issue was that an oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime . A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq . As a result , signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in danger of attack from Mi'kmaq .   In the Grand Dérangement ( the Great Upheaval ) , more than 12,000 Acadians ( three - fourths of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia ) were expelled from the colony between 1755 and 1764 . The British destroyed around 6,000 Acadian houses and dispersed the Acadians among the 13 colonies from Massachusetts to Georgia . The single event that involved the most deaths of Acadians was the sinking of the Duke William . Although there were no purposeful attempts to separate families , this did occur in the chaos of the eviction .  Siege of Louisbourg ( 1758 ) Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance ( edit ) Marquis de Boishébert - Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot ( 1753 )  With the Expulsion of the Acadians during the French and Indian War , the Mi'kmaq and Acadian resistance intensified . After the Expulsion began , much of the resistance was led by Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq again engaged victoriously in the Battle of Petitcodiac ( 1755 ) and the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1757 ) . Acadians who were being deported from Annapolis Royal , Nova Scotia , on the ship Pembroke defeated the British crew and sailed to land . There was also resistance during the St. John River Campaign . Boishebert also ordered the Raid on Lunenburg ( 1756 ) . In the spring of 1756 , a wood - gathering party from Fort Monckton ( former Fort Gaspareaux ) , was ambushed and nine of them were scalped .   In the April 1757 , a band of Acadian and Mi'kmaq raided a warehouse near Fort Edward , killing thirteen British soldiers and , after taking what provisions they could carry , setting fire to the building . A few days later , the same partisans also raided Fort Cumberland .   Some Acadians escaped into the woods and lived with the Mi'kmaq ; some bands of partisans fought the British , including a group led by Joseph Broussard , known as `` Beausoleil '' , along the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick . Some followed the coast northward , facing famine and disease . Some were recaptured , facing deportation or imprisonment at Fort Beausejour ( renamed Fort Cumberland ) until 1763 .   Some Acadians became indentured servants in the British colonies . Massachusetts passed a law in November 1755 placing the Acadians under the custody of `` justices of the peace and overseers of the poor '' ; Pennsylvania , Maryland , and Connecticut adopted similar laws . The Province of Virginia under Robert Dinwiddie initially agreed to resettle about one thousand Acadians who arrived in the colony but later ordered most deported to England , writing that the `` French people '' were `` intestine enemies '' that were `` murdering and scalping our frontier Settlers '' .   In 1758 , after the fall of Louisbourg , over 3,000 Acadians were deported to northern France . Resettlement attempts were tried in Châtellerault , Nantes , and Belle Île off Brittany . The French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon near Newfoundland became a safe harbor for many Acadian families until they were once again deported by the British in 1778 and 1793 .   Re-establishing in Nova Scotia ( edit )   After the end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 , Acadians were allowed to return to Nova Scotia as long as they did not settle in any one area in large numbers ; they were not permitted to resettle in the areas of Port Royal or Grand - Pré . Some Acadians resettled along the Nova Scotia coast and remain scattered across Nova Scotia to this day . Many dispersed Acadians looked for other homes . Beginning in 1764 , groups of Acadians began to arrive in Louisiana ( which had passed to Spanish control in 1762 ) . They eventually became known as Cajuns .   Beginning in the 1770s , many Acadians were encouraged to return through the policies of Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin , who guaranteed Catholic worship , land grants and issued a promise that there would be no second expulsion ( At this time , Nova Scotia included present - day New Brunswick ) . However the fertile Acadian dykelands had been resettled by New England Planters , who were soon followed by Loyalists who further occupied former Acadian lands . Returning Acadians and those families who had escaped expulsion had to settle in other parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , in most cases isolated and infertile lands . The new Acadian settlements were forced to focus more on fishery and later forestry .   Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included :    1767 St. Pierre et Miquelon   1772 census   1774 Founding of Saint - Anne 's church ; the Acadian school at Rustico and the abby Jean - Louis Beaubien ; the Trappistines in Tracadie   1785 Displacement from Fort Sainte - Anne to the upper Saint John River valley ( Madawaska )    Nineteenth century ( edit )   Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included :    Jean - Mandé Sigogne ( 6 April 1763 -- 9 November 1844 ) was a French Catholic priest , who moved to Canada after the Revolution and became known for his missionary work among the Acadians of Nova Scotia .   1836 Simon d'Entremont and Frédéric Robichaud , MLAs in N.S.   1846 Amand Landry , MLA in N.B.   1847 , Longfellow publishes Evangeline   1854 , Stanislaw - Francois Poirier , MLA in P.E.I   1854 , the seminary Saint - Thomas in Memramcook , New Brunswick , becomes the first upper - level school for Acadians   1859 , the first history of Acadia is published in French by Edme Rameau de Saint - Père ; Acadians begin to become aware of their own existence    Acadian Renaissance ( edit )  Le Moniteur Acadien - first Acadian newspaper ( 1867 )   1864 founding of the Farmers ' Bank of Rustico , the earliest known community bank in Canada , under the leadership of Rev.

More than 5,000 Acadians participated in the convention . It was decided that August 15 , the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary , would be chosen to celebrate Acadian culture as National Acadian Day . Other debates at the convention centered around education , agriculture , emigration , colonization , and newspapers , and these same issues would arise at subsequent conventions .   At the second convention , on August 15 , 1884 , in Miscouche , Prince Edward Island , the Acadian flag , an anthem - Ave Maris Stella , and a motto - L'union fait la force were adopted .   1885 , John A. Macdonald nominates Pascal Poirier from Shediac as the first Acadian senator ; a second Acadian newspaper published , Le Courrier des Provinces Maritimes   1887 , the newspaper L'Evangéline begins being published from Digby , later , in 1905 , moves to Moncton   1890 , third Acadian convention    Twentieth century ( edit )   Milestones of the Acadian Renaissance    1912 , Monsigneur Edouard LeBlanc is the first Acadian bishop in The Maritimes   1917 , the Conservative Aubin - Edmond Arsenault becomes the first Acadian premier of P.E.I.   1920 , 2nd Acadian bishop , Mgr Alexandre Chiasson in Chatham and later Bathurst ; la Société nationale de l'Assomption undertakes a campaign to build a commemorative church in Grand - Pré , Nova Scotia   1923 , Pierre - Jean Véniot becomes the first Acadian premier of N.B. but was not elected   1936 , the first Caisse Populaire Acadien in Petit - Rocher is founded ; the committee France - Acadie is founded   1955 , the first Tintamarre occurs .      An Acadian home along Cabot Trail , Cape Breton , Nova Scotia , 1938     An Acadian lady spinning wool , 1938     An Acadian lady making a rug , 1938     The quiet revolution ( edit )   Louis Robichaud , popularly known as `` P'tit - Louis '' , was the first elected Acadian Premier of New Brunswick , serving from 1960 to 1970 . First elected to the legislature in 1952 , he became provincial Liberal leader in 1958 and led his party to victory in 1960 , 1963 , and 1967 .   Robichaud modernized the province 's hospitals and public schools and introduced a wide range of reforms in an era that became known as the quiet revolution . To carry out these reforms , Robichaud restructured the municipal tax regime , expanded the government and sought to ensure that the quality of health care , education and social services was the same across the province -- a programme he called equal opportunity , is still a buzzword in New Brunswick .   Critics accused of Robichaud 's government of `` robbing Peter to pay Pierre '' with the assumption being that rich municipalities were Anglophone ones and poor municipalities were Francophone ones . While it was true that the wealthier municipalities were predominantly in certain English - speaking areas , areas with significantly inferior services were to be found across the province in all municipalities .   Robichaud was instrumental in the formation of New Brunswick 's only French - speaking university , the Université de Moncton , in 1963 , which serves the Acadian population of the Maritime provinces .   His government also passed an act in 1969 making New Brunswick officially bilingual . `` Language rights '' , he said when he introduced the legislation , `` are more than legal rights . They are precious cultural rights , going deep into the revered past and touching the historic traditions of all our people . ''   1977 , official opening of the Acadian Historic Village in Caraquet , New Brunswick .   Antonine Maillet ( edit )   Born 1929 in Bouctouche , Antonine Maillet is an Acadian novelist , playwright , and scholar . Maillet received a BA and MA from the Université de Moncton , followed by a Ph. D. in literature in 1970 from the Université Laval . Maillet won the 1972 Governor General 's Award for Fiction for Don l'Orignal . In 1979 , Maillet published Pélagie - la - Charrette , for which she won the prix Goncourt . Maillet 's character `` La Sagouine '' ( from her book of the same name ) is the inspiration for `` Le Pays de la Sagouine '' in her hometown of Bouctouche .   Twenty - first century ( edit )   In 2003 , at the request of Acadian representatives , a proclamation was issued in the name of Queen Elizabeth II , acting as the Canadian monarch , officially acknowledging the deportation and establishing July 28 as a day of commemoration . The day of commemoration is observed by the Government of Canada , as the successor of the British Government .   Acadian remembrance day ( edit )   The Fédération des Associations de Familles Acadiennnes of New Brunswick and the Société Saint - Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island has resolved that December 13 each year shall be commemorated as `` Acadian Remembrance Day '' in remembrance of all Acadians who died as a result of the deportation . The date December 13 was chosen to commemorate the sinking of the Duke William and the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from Île - Saint Jean who perished in the North Atlantic from hunger , disease and drowning in 1758 . The event has been commemorated annually since 2004 and participants mark the event by wearing a black star .   Acadian World Congress ( edit )   Beginning in 1994 , the Acadian community gathered for an Acadian World Congress in New Brunswick . The congress has been held every 5 years since then : in Louisiana in 1999 , in Nova Scotia in 2004 , in the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick in 2009 . The 5th Acadian World Congress was hosted in 2014 by a gathering of 40 different communities located in three different provinces and different states in two countries . Northwestern New Brunswick and Témiscouata , Quebec , in Canada as well as Northern Maine in the United States joined hands to host the 5th CMA .

They cover most of the North Carolina coastline , separating the Currituck Sound , Albemarle Sound , and Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic Ocean .   The Outer Banks are a major tourist destination and are known around the world for their subtropical climate and wide expanse of open beachfront . The Cape Hatteras National Seashore has four campgrounds open to visitors . The treacherous seas off the Outer Banks and the large number of shipwrecks that have occurred there have given these seas the nickname Graveyard of the Atlantic . The Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum is located in Hatteras Village near a United States Coast Guard facility and the Hatteras ferry .   The English Roanoke Colony -- where Virginia Dare was born -- vanished from Roanoke Island in 1587 . The Lost Colony , written and performed to commemorate the original colonists , is the second longest running outdoor drama in the United States and its theater acts as a cultural focal point for much of the Outer Banks .   The Wright brothers ' first flight in a controlled , powered , heavier - than - air vehicle took place on the Outer Banks on December 17 , 1903 , at Kill Devil Hills near the seafront town of Kitty Hawk . The Wright Brothers National Monument commemorates the historic flights , and First Flight Airport is a small , general - aviation airfield located there .

From north to south , the largest of these include : Bodie Island ( which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes ) , Hatteras Island , Ocracoke Island , Portsmouth Island , and the Core Banks . Over time , the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up , often during a breach created during violent storms , and older inlets close , usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution .   The Outer Banks stretch southward from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach down the North Carolina coastline . Sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the Outer Banks . Generations of North Carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state 's three prominent capes : Cape Hatteras , Cape Lookout , and Cape Fear . Other sources limit the definition to two capes ( Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout ) and coastal areas in four counties ( Currituck County , Dare County , Hyde County , and Carteret County ) . Some authors include Carteret 's Shackelford Banks and Bogue Banks in their descriptions , while others exclude Bogue Banks . Still other references restrict the definition to the northern three counties of Currituck , Dare , and Hyde .   The abbreviations OBX ( Outer Banks ) and SOBX ( Southern Outer Banks ) are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers , t - shirts , and other items to vacationers . OBX , which originated first , is generally used in the northern Outer Banks . SOBX is used primarily in Carteret County , which is also known as the Crystal Coast .   The northern part of the Outer Banks , from Oregon Inlet northward , is actually a part of the North American mainland , since the northern inlets of Bodie Island and Currituck Banks no longer exist . It is separated by the Currituck Sound and the Intracoastal Waterway , which passes through the Great Dismal Swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the Outer Banks . Road access to the northern Outer Banks is cut off between Sandbridge and Corolla , North Carolina , with communities such as Carova Beach accessible only by four - wheel drive vehicles . North Carolina State Highway 12 links most of the popular Outer Banks communities in this section of the coast . The easternmost point is Cape Point at Cape Hatteras on Hatteras Island , site of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse .   The Outer Banks are not anchored to offshore coral reefs like some other barrier islands and as a consequence they often suffer significant beach erosion during major storms . In fact , their location jutting out into the Atlantic makes them the most hurricane - prone area north of Florida , for both landfalling storms and brushing storms offshore . Hatteras Island was cut in half on September 18 , 2003 , when Hurricane Isabel washed a 2,000 foot ( 600 m ) wide and 15 foot ( 5 m ) deep channel called Isabel Inlet through the community of Hatteras Village on the southern end of the island . The tear was subsequently repaired and restored by sand dredging by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . It was cut off once again in 2011 by Hurricane Irene . Access to the island was largely limited to boat access only from August to late October until another temporary bridge could be built .   Vegetation ( edit )   The vegetation of the Outer Banks varies . In the northeast part of the Outer Banks , from Virginia Beach southward past the North Carolina border to Oregon Inlet , the main types of vegetation are sea grasses , beach grasses and other beach plants including Opuntia humifusa on the Atlantic side and wax myrtles , bays , and grasses on the Sound side with areas of pine and Spanish moss - covered live oaks . Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach . Sabal Minor palms were once indigenous to the entire Outer Banks , and they are still successfully planted and grown . Its current most northerly known native stand is on Monkey Island in Currituck County .   From Cape Hatteras National Seashore southward , the vegetation does include that of the northeastern Outer Banks such as Sabal minor , Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa ; however , the main vegetation consists of Cabbage palmetto ( Sabal palmetto ) , which can be found in the north , although they are native in the southern part of the Outer Banks , specifically prevalent from Cape Hatteras and all points southward . Pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the Outer Banks ; although , they are not indigenous to the area .   A wide variety of native plants can be found at the Elizabethan Gardens in Manteo on Roanoke Island . The gardens are open year round , 7 days a week .   Weather ( edit )   The Outer Banks have unusual weather patterns because of their unique geographical location . As the islands are jutted out from the eastern seaboard into the Atlantic Gulf Stream , the Outer Banks has a predisposition to be affected by hurricanes , Nor'easters ( usually in the form of rain , and rarely snow or mixed precipitation ) , and other ocean - driven storms .   The winters are typically milder than in inland areas , averaging lows in the upper 30s and highs in the lower 50s , and is more frequently overcast than in the summer . However , the exposure of the Outer Banks makes them prone to higher winds , often causing wind chills to make the apparent temperature as cold as the inland areas . The summer months average lows from the mid-70s to highs in the upper 80s , depending on the time of the summer . The spring and fall are typically milder seasons . The fall and winter are usually warmer than areas inland , while the spring and the summer are often slightly cooler because of the moderating effects of being surrounded by water .   Although snow is possible , averaging from 3 inches in the north to less than 1 / 2 inch per year in the south , there are many times when years pass between snowfalls . The majority of nor'easters are `` born '' off the coasts of the Outer Banks .   Culture ( edit )  Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum , Hatteras , North Carolina , June 2007  Archeologists believe that the Outer Banks were inhabited for well over a thousand years before the arrival of Europeans , with small branches of larger tribes , such as Algonquins , Chowanog , and Poteskeet , setting up homes all along the barrier islands from Corolla to Hatteras . European explorers to the Outer Banks as far back as the 1500s noted encountering the friendly Hatteras Island and Outer Banks natives , noting their hospitality to foreign explorers as well as their happiness and overall quality of life . European - borne diseases and migration to the mainland were likely the main causes for the decline of the native population .   Before bridges were built in the 1930s , the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat , which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland . This helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive Outer Banks accent or brogue , which sounds more like an English accent than it does an American accent . Many `` bankers '' have often been mistaken for being from England or Ireland when traveling to areas outside of the Outer Banks . The brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the Outer Banks , with it being the thickest on Ocracoke Island and Harkers Island .   Some residents of the Outer Banks , known as wreckers , made part of their living by scavenging wrecked ships -- or by luring ships to their destruction . Horses with lanterns tied to their necks would be walked along the beach ; the lanterns ' up and down motion would appear to ships to represent clear water and a ship ahead ; the unsuspecting captain would then drive his ship ashore following this false light .   The islands are home to herds of feral horses , sometimes called `` banker ponies , '' which according to local legend are descended from Spanish Mustangs washed ashore centuries ago in shipwrecks . Populations are found on Ocracoke Island , Shackleford Banks , Currituck Banks , and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary .   Ocracoke was the last refuge of pirate Edward Teach , better known as Blackbeard . It is also where the infamous pirate was killed November 22 , 1718 in a fierce battle with troops from Virginia .   The Outer Banks is home to Yaupon Holly ( Ilex vomitoria ) , the roasted leaves of which were brewed into a high caffeine beverage called black drink by the Native Americans . The Outer Banks may be one of the few places where it is still consumed .     Fishing ( edit )       This section contains content that is written like an advertisement .

( July 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The Outer Banks offers a multitude of fishing options for tourists as well as locals . There has been a long history of fishing in the Outer Banks , dating back to the end of the 17th century . Pirates ravaged the coast for the majority of the 1600s , but once they were ridden , the local settlers used fishing as their lifeline . Then , in the mid-19th century , large - scale commercial fishing erupted , mostly due to the construction of the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal , which simplified shipping methods for fishermen . Saltwater fishing became the cash - crop of the Outer Banks , and blossomed it into a popular tourist destination . In modern times , tourists will flock to the area just for the abundance of fishing opportunities . Anglers , otherwise known as fishermen , have a wide range of fishing methods , some of these methods date back to when the first settlers arrived , to choose from in the Outer Banks .    Fly fishing   This was brought about in the 1950s when modern fly fishing experts like , Joe Brooks and Jimmy Albright , were successfully catching a variety of gamefish on the flats of the Florida Keys and on the Currituck Sound , which is included in the stretch of the Outer Banks . Modern fly fishers in the Outer Banks pursue a variety of gamefish from red drum , to marlin and tuna .   Brackish fishing   This is a separate type of fishing than complete saltwater because of the abundance of new species that are able to live in brackish water . The Outer Banks has multiple Sounds that receive water from the Atlantic Ocean and many North Carolina fresh - water rivers , creating an estuary for many types of fish including , striped bass , puppy drum , and speckled trout .   Offshore fishing   Thriving in the Outer Banks , this is the type of fishing this area is known for . Offshore fishing is the method of heading out to sea to the Gulf Stream , where giant species such as billfish , tuna and dolphin lurk . Anglers can book charters or use their own personal boat , but a larger boat is necessary to reach the deep water where the big fish are prevalent .   Inshore fishing   Guides local to the Outer Banks will often escort new anglers around the area to sounds and piers where they are guaranteed a catch . Whether the customer is a novice or veteran with their fishing skills , the inshore guide is someone that is there to help .   Pier fishing   The Outer Banks are one of the few coastal areas left with more than one fishing pier along the coast , so anglers attract to the area for an opportunity to pier fish . Pier Fishing is an easy way for anglers to get a little off - shore mixed with some inshore fishing . It is where fishermen can catch any type of fish they please , as long as it is the season for it .    The Outer Banks are a popular destination for bottom fish like spot and mullet , these two types of fish are caught throughout the year . The peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of May . If the angler is solely searching for top water fish , then late May and June would be the ideal time to fish , especially if they are searching for Mackerel . In the offseason , or winter months , the true fishermen are out searching for Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin Tuna , Oysters , King Mackerel , Bay Scallops , and Striped Bass . In the spring , the popular catches are Grouper , Sea Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin and Yellowfin tuna , Oysters , Snapper , Striped Bass , Red Drum , Croaker , Sea Mullet , King Mackerel , and Wahoo Late Spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top - water fish to move into the coastal waters near the Outer Banks , because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water The top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water Plus they will start to migrate back North as the coastal waters to the south become too hot , the waters farther North will warm to their desired temperatures . Yet , in the prime tourist season of the summer , fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as blue Marlin , White Marlin , Dolphin , Wahoo , Cobia , King Mackerel , Bluefish , Tuna , Flounder , snapper , Grouper , Spanish Mackerel , Crabs , Soft Crabs , Shrimp , Spot , Croaker , Sailfish , and Sea Mullet . By the fall , most tourists have started to leave , but fishermen are still out searching for Snapper , Channel Bass , Bluefish , King Mackerel , Grouper , Tuna , Oysters , Striped Bass , Sea Mullet , Spot , Clams , Speckled Trout , Flounder , and Shrimp . The prime season for fall fishing is late September to October 23 . Though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast prevailing winds , there is still some big game fish left . Most of these fish are vacating back to the South for the warm waters . This makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky , colder water .

( December 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In 1900 , the First Philippine Commission passed Act No. 52 , which placed all banks under the Bureau of the Treasury and authorizing the Insular Treasurer to supervise and examine banks and all banking activity . In 1929 , the Department of Finance , through the Bureau of Banking , took over bank supervision .   By 1933 , a group of Filipinos had conceptualised a central bank for the Philippine Islands . It came up with the rudiments of a bill for the establishment of a central bank after a careful study of the economic provisions of the Hare -- Hawes -- Cutting Act , which would grant Philippine independence after 12 years , but reserving military and naval bases for the United States and imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports . However , the Hare -- Hawes -- Cutting Act would be rejected by the Senate of the Philippines at the urging of Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon . This Senate then advocated a new bill that won United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's support , this would be the Tydings -- McDuffie Act , which would grant Philippine independence on July 4 , 1946 .   Under the Commonwealth , discussions continued regarding the idea of a Philippine central bank that would promote price stability and economic growth . The country 's monetary system then was administered by the Department of Finance and the National Treasury , and the Philippine piso was on the exchange standard using the United States dollar , which was backed by 100 percent gold reserve , as the standard currency .   As required by the Tydings -- McDuffie Act , the National Assembly of the Philippines in 1939 passed a law establishing a central bank . As it was a monetary law , it required the approval of the President of the United States ; Franklin D. Roosevelt did not give his . A second law was passed in 1944 under the Japanese - controlled Second Republic during the Second World War , but the 1945 arrival of American liberation forces , aided by Philippine Commonwealth troops and recognised guerrillas , aborted its implementation .   Third Republic and martial law ( edit )   Shortly after President Manuel Roxas assumed office in 1946 , he instructed then - Finance Secretary Miguel Cuaderno , Sr. to draw up a charter for a central bank . The establishment of a monetary authority became imperative a year later as a result of the findings of the Joint Philippine - American Finance Commission chaired by Cuaderno . The Commission , which studied Philippine financial , monetary , and fiscal problems in 1947 , recommended a shift from the dollar exchange standard to a managed currency system . A central bank was necessary to implement the proposed shift to the new system .   Roxas then created the Central Bank Council to prepare the charter of a proposed monetary authority . It was submitted to Congress in February 1948 . By June of the same year , the newly proclaimed President Elpidio Quirino , who succeeded President Roxas , affixed his signature on Republic Act ( RA ) No. 265 , the Central Bank Act of 1948. On January 3 , 1949 , the Central Bank of the Philippines was formally inaugurated with Miguel Cuaderno , Sr. as the first governor . The main duties and responsibilities of the Central Bank were to promote economic development and maintain internal and external monetary stability .   Over the years , changes were introduced to make the charter more responsive to the needs of the economy . On November 29 , 1972 , President Ferdinand Marcos ' Presidential Decree No. 72 amended Republic Act No. 265 , emphasizing the maintenance of domestic and international monetary stability as the primary objective of the Central Bank . The Bank 's authority was also expanded to include regulation of the entire financial system of the Philippines and not just supervision of the banking system . In 1981 , RA 265 , as amended , was further improved to strengthen the financial system , among the changes was the increase in the capitalization of the Central Bank from Php 10 million to Php 10 billion .   In the 1973 Constitution , the interim Batasang Pambansa ( National Assembly ) was mandated to establish an independent central monetary authority . Presidential Decree No. 1801 designated the Central Bank of the Philippines as the central monetary authority ( CMA ) . Years later , the 1987 Constitution adopted the CMA provisions from the 1973 Constitution that were aimed essentially at establishing an independent monetary authority through increased capitalization and greater private sector representation in the Monetary Board .   Present ( edit )   In accordance with a provision in the 1987 Constitution , President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act No. 7653 , otherwise known as the New Central Bank Act , into law on June 14 , 1993 . The law provides for the establishment of an independent monetary authority to be known as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas , its primary objective being the maintenance of price stability . This objective was only implied in the old Central Bank charter . The law also gives the Bangko Sentral fiscal and administrative autonomy which the old Central Bank did not have . On July 3 , 1993 , the New Central Bank Act took effect .  BSP Branch in Zamboanga City .  On the evening of September 26 , 2012 , a Wednesday , the BSP website was hacked by a group named Anonymous Philippines in a protest against the recently passed Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 . The website was promptly restored in the early hours of the following day .   On April 23 , 2013 , The Asian Banker named the BSP as the Best Macroeconomic Regulator in the Asia - Pacific Region for 2013 in The Asian Banker Leadership Achievement Awards in Jakarta , Indonesia . The BSP was cited as a `` good , strong , and fair - minded regulator . '' About a month later , the BSP was given the country award by the Child and Youth Finance International in its 2013 International Summit in Istanbul , Turkey , in recognition of its initiative to integrate financial education in the Philippine elementary school curriculum .   Roles and responsibilities ( edit )   As prescribed by the New Central Bank Act , the main functions of the Bangko Sentral are :    Liquidity management , by formulating and implementing monetary policy aimed at influencing money supply , consistent with its primary objective to maintain price stability ,   Currency issue . The BSP has the exclusive power to issue the national currency . All notes and coins issued by the BSP are fully guaranteed by the Government and are considered legal tender for all private and public debts ,   Lender of last resort , by extending discounts , loans and advances to banking institutions for liquidity purposes ,   Financial supervision , by supervising banks and exercising regulatory powers over non-bank institutions performing quasi-banking functions ,   Management of foreign currency reserves , by maintaining sufficient international reserves to meet any foreseeable net demands for foreign currencies in order to preserve the international stability and convertibility of the Philippine peso ,   Determination of exchange rate policy , by determining the exchange rate policy of the Philippines . Currently , the BSP adheres to a market - oriented foreign exchange rate policy , and   Being the banker , financial advisor and official depository of the Government , its political subdivisions and instrumentalities and GOCCs .    Organization of the Bangko Sentral ( edit )   The basic structure of the Bangko Sentral includes :    The Monetary Board , which exercises the powers and functions of the BSP , such as the conduct of monetary policy and supervision of the financial system ;   The Monetary Stability Sector , which takes charge of the formulation and implementation of the BSP 's monetary policy , including serving the banking needs of all banks through accepting deposits , servicing withdrawals and extending credit through the rediscounting facility ;   The Supervision and Examination Sector , which enforces and monitors compliance to banking laws to promote a sound and healthy banking system ; and   The Resource Management Sector , which serves the human , financial and physical resource needs of the BSP .    The powers and function of Bangko Sentral are exercised by its Monetary Board , whose seven members are appointed by the President of the Philippines . As provided for by RA 7653 or the New Central Bank Act , one of the government sector members of the Monetary Board must also be a member of Cabinet . Members of the Monetary Board are prohibited from holding certain positions in other government agencies and private institutions that may give rise to conflicts of interest . The members have fixed and overlapping terms , except for the Cabinet Secretary representing the incumbent administration .   The current members of the Monetary Board are :    Nestor Espenilla , Jr. , BSP Governor and Chairman of the Monetary Board   Carlos Dominguez III , Secretary of the Department of Finance   Antonio S. Abacan , Jr .   Juan D. De Zuñiga , Jr .   V. Bruce J. Tolentino   Felipe M. Medalla   Peter B. Favila    Convertible currencies ( edit )   The Bangko Sentral has 19 currencies directly convertible with the Philippine piso , which serves as a benchmark for all Philippine banks .       Australian dollar ( AUD )   Bahraini dinar ( BHD )   British pound ( GBP )   Brunei dollar ( BND )   Canadian dollar ( CAD )   Dominican peso ( DOP )   Chinese yuan ( CNY )   Euro ( EUR )   Hong Kong dollar ( HKD )         Indonesian rupiah ( IDR )   Japanese yen ( JPY )   Mexican peso ( MXN )   Korean won ( KRW )   Kuwaiti dinar ( KWD )   Saudi riyal ( SAR )   Singapore dollar ( SGD )   Swiss franc ( CHF )         Thai baht ( THB )   New Taiwan dollar ( TWD )   United Arab Emirates dirham ( AED )   United States dollar ( USD )         Microfinance and financial Inclusion ( edit )   In 2000 , the General Banking Law mandated the BSP to recognize microfinance as a legitimate banking activity and to set the rules and regulations for its practice within the banking sector . In the same year , the BSP declared microfinance as its flagship program for poverty alleviation . The BSP has become the prime advocate for the development of microfinance . To this end , the Bangko Sentral aims to :    Provide the enabling policy and regulatory environment ;   Increase the capacity of the BSP and banking sector on microfinance operations ; and   Promote and advocate for the development of sound and sustainable microfinance operations .    The Bank is active in promoting a financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion . It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration during the 2011 Global Policy Forum held in Mexico .   Anti-Money Laundering ( edit )   With money laundering being one of the problems of the Philippines , the BSP has issued a number of measures to bring the Philippines ' regulatory regime on money laundering closer to international standards . In September 2001 , the Anti-Money Laundering Act , or AMLA , was signed into law . The AMLA defined money laundering a criminal offense , and prescribed corresponding penalties . It also provided the foundation for a central monitoring and implementing council called the Anti-Money Laundering Council ( AMLC ) . The AMLC is composed of the Governor of the Bangko Sentral as Chair , and the Commissioner of the Insurance Commission and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission as members , all acting unanimously in the discharge of the group 's mandate .   In February 2013 , Philippine President Benigno Aquino III signed R.A. No. 10365 , known as An act further strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering Law , which aims to strengthen the AMLC by requiring that any suspicious transaction in foreign exchange , real estate , and jewelry and precious metal trading be reported .   Governors ( edit )  Main article : Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  Museum ( edit )   Within the Manila complex of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is the Museo ng Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( English : Museum of the Central Bank of the Philippines ) . Inaugurated on January 3 , 1999 , as part of the celebration of the 50 years of central banking in the Philippines , the museum showcases the Bank 's collection of currencies .   As repository and custodian of the country 's numismatic heritage , the Museo collects , studies and preserves coins , paper notes , medals , artifacts and monetary items found in the Philippines during its different historical periods . These collections have been placed on permanent display at the Museo .

Complementary paintings from the BSP art collection , together with chosen artifacts , enhance each gallery .   A panoramic memorabilia of 50 years of central banking in the Philippines , showcases the strides made in bringing about price stability , to sustain economic growth in the country . The exhibition hall also carries the busts of the governors of the Central Bank / Bangko Sentral .

Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources . ( October 2010 )     Takt time is the average time between the start of production of one unit and the start of production of the next unit , when these production starts are set to match the rate of customer demand . For example , if a customer wants 10 units per week , then , given a 40 - hour work week and steady flow through the production line , the average time between production starts should be 4 hours , yielding 10 units produced per week . Note , a common misconception is that takt time is related to the time it takes to actually make the product . In the previous example , whether it takes 4 minutes or 4 years to produce the product , the takt time should be 4 hours ( of course , the time it takes to produce the product will impact the magnitude of the number of units actually in production at any point in time ) .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Etymology   2 Definition   3 Implementation   4 See also   5 References   6 External links   7 Further reading      Etymology ( edit )   Takt time is a borrowing of the Japanese word takutotaimu ( タクト タイム ) , which in turn was borrowed from the German word Taktzeit , meaning clock interval . The word was likely introduced to Japan by German engineers in the 1930s .   Definition ( edit )   Assuming a product is made one unit at a time at a constant rate during the net available work time , the takt time is the amount of time that must elapse between two consecutive unit completions in order to meet the demand .   Takt time can be first determined with the formula :    T = T a D ( \\\\ displaystyle T = ( \\\\ frac ( T_ ( a ) ) ( D ) ) )    Where T = Takt time , e.g. ( work time between two consecutive units ) T = Net time available to work , e.g. ( work time per period ) D = Demand ( customer demand ) , e.g. ( units required per period )   Net available time is the amount of time available for work to be done . This excludes break times and any expected stoppage time ( for example scheduled maintenance , team briefings , etc . ) .   Example : If there are a total of 8 hours ( or 480 minutes ) in a shift ( gross time ) less 30 minutes lunch , 30 minutes for breaks ( 2 × 15 mins ) , 10 minutes for a team briefing and 10 minutes for basic maintenance checks , then the net Available Time to Work = 480 - 30 - 30 - 10 - 10 = 400 minutes .   If customer demand were 400 units a day and one shift were being run , then the line would be required to output at a minimum rate of one part per minute in order to be able to keep up with customer demand .   In reality , people and machines can not maintain 100 % efficiency and there will be stoppages for other reasons . Allowances should be made for these instances , and thus the line will be set up to run at a faster rate to account for this .   Also , takt time may be adjusted according to requirements within the company . For example , if one department delivers parts to several manufacturing lines , it often makes sense to use similar takt times on all lines to smooth out flow from the preceding station . Customer demand can still be met by adjusting daily working time , reducing down times on machines and so on .   Some of the early literature uses cycle time for takt time .   Implementation ( edit )   Takt time is calculated on virtually every task in a business environment . It is used in manufacturing ( casting of parts , drilling holes , or preparing a workplace for another task ) , control tasks ( testing of parts or adjusting machinery ) , or in administration ( answering standard inquiries or call center operation ) . It is , however , most common in production lines that move a product along a line of stations that each performs a set of predefined tasks .   Once a takt system is implemented there are a number of benefits :    The product moves along a line , so bottlenecks ( stations that need more time than planned ) are easily identified when the product does not move on in time .   Correspondingly , stations that do n't operate reliably ( suffer frequent breakdown , etc . ) are easily identified .   The takt leaves only a certain amount of time to perform the actual value added work . Therefore , there is a strong motivation to get rid of all non value - adding tasks ( like machine set - up , gathering of tools , transporting products , etc . )   Workers and machines perform sets of similar tasks , so they do n't have to adapt to new processes every day , increasing their productivity .   There is no place in the takt system for removal of a product from the assembly line at any point before completion , so opportunities for shrink and damage in transit are minimized .    Downsides of takt time organization include :    When customer demand rises so much that takt time has to come down , quite a few tasks have to be either reorganized to take even less time to fit into the shorter takt time , or they have to be split up between two stations ( which means another station has to be squeezed into the line and workers have to adapt to the new setup )   When one station in the line breaks down for whatever reason the whole line comes to a grinding halt , unless there are buffer capacities for preceding stations to get rid of their products and following stations to feed from . A built - in buffer of three to five percent downtime allows needed adjustments or recovery from failures .   Short takt time can put considerable stress on the `` moving parts '' of a production system or subsystem . In automated systems / subsystems , increased mechanical stress increases the likelihood of breakdown , and in non-automated systems / subsystems , personnel face both increased physical stress ( which increases the risk of repetitive motion ( also `` stress or `` strain '' ) injury ) , intensified emotional stress , and lowered motivation , sometimes to the point of increased absenteeism .   Tasks have to be leveled to make sure tasks do n't bulk in front of certain stations due to peaks in workload . This decreases the flexibility of the system as a whole .

The story features classic Seuss rhymes and drawings in his distinctive pen and ink style .   The book is a first - person narrative told by a young narrator who experiences troubles in his life ( mostly aggressive small animals that bite and sting ) and wishes to escape them . He sets out for the city of Solla Sollew ( `` where they never have troubles / at least very few '' ) and learns that he must face his problems instead of running away from them . He then goes back home to deal with his `` troubles '' , arming himself with a big bat and resolving that `` Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me ! ''   The journey includes several fantastic , and troublesome , encounters . In one instance , the protagonist is forced to haul a wagon for a bossy companion . ( `` ' This is called teamwork . I furnish the brains . You furnish the muscles , the aches and the pains . ' '' ) In another scene , he is drafted into the army under the command of the fearsome ( and , ultimately , cowardly ) General Genghis Kahn Schmitz , who abandons him at a critical moment .   Plot ( edit )   As the story opens , the young protagonist ( resembling a cat or dog ) lives a happy and carefree life in the Valley of Vung , but one day , all that changes when he goes out for a stroll to look at daisies and hurts himself by tripping over a rock , which sets off the troubles he will soon face . The protagonist vows to be more careful , but a green - headed Quilligan Quail bites his tail from behind ( `` I learned there are troubles of more than one kind ; Some come from ahead and some come from behind '' ) . Worse still , a Skritz dives to sting his neck and a Skrink bites his toe , proving that troubles can come from all directions .   As the protagonist tries to fight off his troubles , a man on a One Wheel Wubble drawn by a camel comes up and explains that like the protagonist , he too is experiencing a troubled life and has decided to escape his troubles by going to Solla Sollew , a city on the beautiful banks of the river Wah - Hoo , and known to never have troubles ( at least very few ) . He invites the protagonist to come along with him . Eager to escape his troubles , the protagonist joins the wubble driver , but after a long night of traveling , the camel gets sick and starts to bubble . At first , the driver and protagonist pull him on the wubble , but for the rest of the day , the driver acts lazy and has the protagonist do all the hard work .   The next day they thankfully discover a camel doctor , Dr. Sam Snell , who diagnoses their camel with a bad case of gleeks and orders him to bed for twenty weeks . The driver makes it up to the protagonist by telling him he can catch the 4 : 42 bus to Solla Sollew at the nearest bus stop , but when the protagonist gets to the bus stop he learns from a sign tacked on a stick that the Solla Sollew bound bus is out of service ( the driver , Butch Myers , apparently destroyed all his tires from accidentally running over four nails ) , leaving him to hike for one hundred miles . Soon , the poor protagonist is caught in a storm . A kindly stranger tells him that the storm is the infamous `` Midwinter Jicker '' and allows the protagonist to take shelter in his house , where a family of mice and a family of owls are also taking shelter .   After a sleepless night and dreaming of sleeping in Solla Sollew , the protagonist awakens to find that the flood - waters have washed the house over a cliff , with him still inside . He spends twelve days in the flood - waters , until somebody rescues him by throwing down a rope . The protagonist climbs the rope , only to discover that his savior is General Genghis Kahn Schmitz , who immediately drafts him into his army for an upcoming battle against the Perilous Poozer of Pompelmoose Pass , a lion - like creature . At the pass , the General discovers he and his army are outnumbered by too many Poozers and orders an immediate retreat without fighting , leaving the protagonist to face the Poozers alone , armed only with `` a shooter and one little bean '' .   The protagonist manages to escape the Poozers by diving down an air vent marked `` Vent No. 5 '' but has to spend the next three days trying to find his way through a network of tunnels inhabited by birds , all going in the wrong direction . Close to the end of the third day , he finally finds a door and discovers he 's come out at the beautiful banks of the river Wah - Hoo . Realizing he 's reached his goal , the protagonist rushes out to Solla Sollew .   At the gates of Solla Sollew , the protagonist is greeted by a friendly doorman . The doorman explains to the protagonist about the only trouble the city has : a key - slapping slippard has moved into the lock of the door , which happens to be the only way into Solla Sollew , and bugs the doorman by continuously slapping the key out of his hand , preventing anyone from entering the city . As it 's considered bad luck to kill a slippard , the doorman can not do anything to evict this pest , but decides instead to leave Solla Sollew for the city of Boola Boo Ball , on the banks of the beautiful river Woo - Wall , and known to never have troubles ( `` No troubles at all ! ! '' ) and invites the protagonist to come along .   At first , the protagonist considers joining the doorman , but realizing that he 's come all this way for nothing , the protagonist , instead , decides to go back home to the Valley of Vung and face his troubles . He now knows he will have troubles for the rest of his life , but he 's ready for them . Armed with a bat , the Protagonist now gives the rocks , quail , skritz , and skrink troubles of their own ( `` But I 've bought a big bat . I 'm all ready , you see . Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me ! '' ) .   In Seussical ( edit )   In Seussical , the character of General Genghis Kahn Schmitz makes an appearance as a secondary character . He introduces JoJo to the military school in song . This sets up a subplot concerning JoJo in which he is thought to be lost in battle . The character of Schmitz in the play is a cross between the Schmitz seen in the book and the unnamed generals in the Butter Battle Book .   Solla Sollew is the subject of a song in which the main characters yearn for a happy resolution to their problems . It is referred to as `` a faraway land , so the stories all tell / somewhere beyond the horizon . '' It is said that `` troubles there are few '' and that `` maybe it 's something like heaven . ''   Solla Sollew is believed to be a place of hope and wonder , where `` breezes are warm '' and `` people are kind . '' It is a dream of the characters to find this incredible place , where they will find each other and be happy once and for all . However , they can not ever find it , saying in the song `` when I get close , it disappears '' .   References ( edit )       This article does not cite any sources .

It was released as a digital download on 6 January 2017 as one of the double lead singles from his third studio album ÷ ( 2017 ) , along with `` Castle on the Hill '' .   The dancehall - infused pop song was written by Ed Sheeran together with Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid , with additional writing credits given to Kandi Burruss , Tameka `` Tiny '' Cottle , and Kevin `` She'kspere '' Briggs as Sheeran had incorporated an interpolation of the TLC 's song `` No Scrubs '' into `` Shape of You '' . The song was produced by Sheeran and Mac .   `` Shape of You '' peaked at number - one on the singles charts of 44 countries , including the US Billboard Hot 100 ( later becoming the best performing song of 2017 ) , as well as the UK , Australian and Canadian singles charts . It has stayed at number one for a record - tying 16 consecutive weeks on the Canadian Hot 100 , as well as 14 non-consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart , and 12 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 .

On 6 January 2017 , when hosting The Radio 1 Breakfast Show , Sheeran revealed that `` Shape of You '' had originally been written with Rihanna in mind . As he had already written all the songs he wanted for the album , the song was therefore not intended to be included in the album . It was conceived as a duet between Rihanna and Rudimental , but the head of the record label convinced him to keep the song for himself . He said :   `` ( ' Shape of You ' ) is actually a really random one because I went in to write songs for other people with a guy called Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid , and we were writing this song and I was like ' this would really work for Rihanna , ' '' he explained . `` And then I started singing lyrics like ' putting Van The Man on the jukebox ' and I was like ' well she 's not really going to sing that , is she ? ' And then we sort of decided halfway through that we were just going to make it for me . ''   According to Sheeran , Steve Mac started the song - writing session by playing the opening notes of the song on the keyboard . Sheeran then joined in , adding percussion by tapping on the guitar , layering it onto the track . On the writing of the song , he said that he tried to keep the music `` more stripped '' instead of something more elaborate : `` I 'm an acoustic artist , first and foremost . And when I play live , I ca n't replicate these things , I have n't got all the other musicians . '' Sheeran said he wanted an R&B feel to the song , therefore he adjusted the original tune , adding an interpolation of `` No Scrubs '' onto part of the melody . He also revealed that the original lyrics did not end with the words `` the shape of you '' in the chorus , but during the writing of the song , McDaid thought that the lyrics `` I 'm in love with your body '' sounded objectifying , and the lyrics was therefore adjusted .   Promotion ( edit )   On 4 January 2017 , Sheeran uploaded a six - second teaser video of a blue background to social media , with lyrics `` the club is n't the best place to find a lover '' , which is the first line of `` Shape of You '' . To further tease the release , Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds on the song to increase buzz among the general public .   Composition ( edit )   `` Shape of You '' is a pop , dancehall and tropical house song with `` strummy acoustics . '' In the song , Sheeran sings over a marimba - fueled percussive sway about a budding romance . `` The club is n't the best place to find a lover , so the bar is where I go / Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow '' , he sings . `` Come over and start up a conversation with just me / And trust me I 'll give it a chance . '' According to NT News , the song `` tells the story of loved ( or lusted ) up Sheeran meeting a girl in a bar where he and his mates are doing shots . '' `` Shape of You '' is written in the key of C ♯ minor with a tempo of 96 beats per minute . The song is composed in common time ( time ) , and follows a basic chord progression of C ♯ m -- F ♯ m -- A -- B ( i -- iv -- VI -- VII ) , and Sheeran 's vocals span from G ♯ to G ♯ .   The song 's lyrical rhythm drew comparisons to the TLC song `` No Scrubs '' , particularly in the pre-chorus line , `` Boy , let 's not talk too much / Grab on my waist and put that body on me . '' As a result , the composers of `` No Scrubs '' , Kandi Burruss , Tameka `` Tiny '' Cottle , and Kevin `` She'kspere '' Briggs , were awarded co-writing credits on `` Shape of You '' .   Critical reception ( edit )   Jon Caramanica from The New York Times said , `` ' Shape of You ' is trickier , a nimble and effective song that takes the aggressive thinning of ' Caribbean music ' . '' Billboard 's Taylor Weatherby wrote about the song saying , `` ' Shape of You ' does n't quite sound like your typical Sheeran tune . But that almost serves as an indication of what the `` Thinking Out Loud '' singer has been up to during his hiatus : creating music that still feels like Sheeran , just with a new twist . '' Jeremy Gordon of Spin gave the song a positive review , stating that the song `` is a plausible attempt at convincing us he has had sex ... a lot of it . It kind of slaps , though you ca n't really picture Sheeran ever saying ' put that body on me ' to a real human woman . '' News website Metro wrote that it sounds similar to the song `` Cheap Thrills '' by Sia .   Commercial Performance ( edit )   `` Shape of You '' debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 13 January , selling 227,000 combined units in its first week . Sheeran also debuted at number 2 with the song `` Castle on the Hill '' , making him the only artist in UK chart history to debut in the top two positions . `` Shape of You '' debuted at number two on the Scottish Singles Chart behind `` Castle on the Hill '' . The song was certified Silver in the first week due to selling 200,000 units and Gold in the second week selling 400,000 units . The song remained at number one in its second week , selling 139,000 . It has stayed at number one for 13 consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart , and a further week at the top after a week 's interruption by Harry Styles ' `` Sign of the Times '' . In July 2017 , the song reached 184 million in streams , making it the most - streamed song in the UK of all time . It was the nation 's highest selling and most streamed track of 2017 with 787,000 copies sold and 248 million streams throughout the year , to produce a combined sales of 3.2 million .

Language   English     Website   www.thenewatlantis.com     ISSN   1543 - 1215 ( print ) 1555 - 5569 ( web )     OCLC number   56518547     The New Atlantis , founded in 2003 , is a quarterly journal about the social , ethical , political , and policy dimensions of modern science and technology . The journal is published in Washington , D.C. by the social conservative advocacy group the Ethics and Public Policy Center in partnership with the Center for the Study of Technology and Society . It is edited by Ari Schulman , having previously been edited by co-founders Eric Cohen and Adam Keiper .   The journal 's name is taken from Francis Bacon 's utopian novella New Atlantis , which the journal 's editors describe as a `` fable of a society living with the benefits and challenges of advanced science and technology . '' An editorial in the inaugural issue states that the aim of the journal is `` to help us avoid the extremes of euphoria and despair that new technologies too often arouse ; and to help us judge when mobilizing our technological prowess is sensible or necessary , and when the preservation of things that count requires limiting the kinds of technological power that would lessen , cheapen , or ultimately destroy us . '' Writing for National Review , editor Adam Keiper described The New Atlantis as being written from a `` particularly American and conservative way of thinking about both the blessings and the burdens of modern science and technology . '' New Atlantis authors and bioethicists publishing in other journals have also similarly referred to The New Atlantis as being written from a social conservative stance which utilizes religion .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Subjects   2 Book Series   3 Contributors   4 Reception   5 References      Subjects ( edit )   The New Atlantis tends to publish views in favor of technological innovation but wary of certain avenues of development . For example , the journal has generally advocated nuclear energy ; space exploration and development through public - private partnerships , including manned missions to Mars ; biofuels ; and genetically modified foods . But it has expressed ambivalent or critical views about developments in synthetic biology and military technologies like drones , chemical weapons , and cyberwarfare . Articles often explore policy questions on these and other issues , sometimes advocating particular policy outcomes , especially on health care , environmental management , and energy .   The journal has published widely on bioethics , including issues such as stem cell research , assisted reproduction , cloning , assisted suicide , organ and tissue donation , the purported link between vaccines and autism , and informed consent . Articles on these issues often highlight the potential for dangerous or degrading developments , including concerns over human dignity , with many articles examining human enhancement , and life extension , and historical precedents for abuse in eugenics and population control .   The journal also features broader philosophical reflections on science and technology , and tends to be skeptical of what its authors consider to be speculative overreach common in popular discussions . Examples include articles that have defended the existence of free will in light of developments in neuroscience , questioned the wisdom of using brain scans in courtrooms , and described how growing knowledge of epigenetics has undermined common claims about genetic determinism . While the journal has sometimes aired libertarian views about human enhancement and transhumanism , its contributors generally tend to question whether technologies like artificial intelligence , `` friendly '' artificial intelligence , and genetic enhancement are possible or desirable . The journal also publishes the Futurisms blog , dedicated to criticizing transhumanism .   The journal has also published widely on the interpersonal effects of the Internet and digital technology . It has featured articles on subjects like Facebook , cell phones , multitasking , e-readers , GPS and navigation , and virtual reality . A 2006 article by Matthew B. Crawford advocating the intellectual and economic virtues of the manual trades was noted as a best - of - the - year essay by New York Times columnist David Brooks , and was subsequently expanded into the bestselling book Shop Class as Soulcraft . The journal also frequently publishes essays on philosophical and literary questions relating to science and technology .   Book series ( edit )   The New Atlantis also publishes a book series , New Atlantis Books , an imprint of Encounter Books . To date , six books have been released :    In the Shadow of Progress : Being Human in the Age of Technology ISBN 9781594032080 ( 2008 ) , by Eric Cohen   Imagining the Future : Science and American Democracy ISBN 9781594032097 ( 2008 ) , by Yuval Levin   Neither Beast nor God : The Dignity of the Human Person ISBN 9781594032578 ( 2009 ) , by Gilbert Meilaender   Merchants of Despair : Radical Environmentalists , Criminal Pseudo-Scientists , and the Fatal Cult of Antihumanism ISBN 9781594034763 ( 2012 ) , by Robert Zubrin   Why Place Matters : Geography , Identity , and Civic Life in Modern America ISBN 9781594037160 ( 2014 ) , edited by Wilfred M.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( August 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Among the more notable contributors to the journal are physicians and bioethicists such as President 's Council on Bioethics chairman Leon Kass and neuroscientist William B. Hurlbut ; prominent scientists such as Raymond Tallis , Sara Seager , and Marcelo Gleiser ; political scientists , legal and ethical scholars , and policy analysts such as Yuval Levin , Robert P. George , Peter Augustine Lawler , Diana Schaub , Charles T. Rubin , Jeffrey Rosen , Larry Arnhart , and Jonathan B. Tucker ; think - tank scholars such as Nicholas Eberstadt , Roger Bate , Henry Sokolski , and Robert D. Atkinson ; space experts and entrepreneurs such as Mars Society founder Robert Zubrin , James C. Bennett , and Jeff Foust ; and philosophers , historians , authors , and journalists such as Roger Scruton , Gertrude Himmelfarb , Matthew B. Crawford , Harvey Mansfield , Wilfred M. McClay , Ross Douthat , Victor Davis Hanson , Alan Jacobs , Varadaraja V. Raman , Stephen D. Snobelen , Andrew Janiak , William R. Newman , and Ronald Bailey .   Reception ( edit )   Writing for the National Review in a 2003 column , the conservative author Stanley Kurtz described The New Atlantis as influential on thinking about science and technology .   Richard John Neuhaus , late editor of the conservative journal First Things , wrote that The New Atlantis is `` as good a publication as there is for the intelligent exploration of questions in bioethics and projections -- promising , ominous , and fantastical -- about the human future , '' and a writer in The American Conservative described the journal as a source `` of fresh ideas on the Right . '' National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg described The New Atlantis as `` a new and interesting magazine '' that `` seems to be trying to carve out the space for the government to stop the more offensive aspects of biotechnology . ''   By contrast , the liberal bioethicist Jonathan D. Moreno has said that the journal offers `` a very dark vision '' about science and technology , but that it `` makes an important point about the need to worry about the ends as well as means in science '' and that its `` writers were young , smart , and had a good understanding of the political process and the making of public policy . '' Bioethicist Ruth Macklin criticized The New Atlantis as representative of a conservative movement in bioethics that is `` mean - spirited , mystical , and emotional '' and that `` claims insight into ultimate truth yet disavows reason . ''   The journal has particularly gained a reputation among the transhumanist movement for its criticism of human enhancement . James Hughes , a techno - progressivist and at times director of organizations such as the World Transhumanist Association and the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies , notes that the journal `` has published influential attacks on artificial intelligence , nanotechnology , biotechnology , reproductive technology , and life extension . '' Natasha Vita - More has described it as a `` journal known as a ring of bioconservatives bent on opposing the cyberculture , '' while the Extropy Institute has called it `` a high - powered rallying point for the neo-Luddites .

For other uses of `` Wonders of the World '' , see Wonders of the World ( disambiguation ) .   The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ( from left to right , top to bottom ) : Great Pyramid of Giza , Hanging Gardens of Babylon , Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , Statue of Zeus at Olympia , Mausoleum at Halicarnassus ( also known as the Mausoleum of Mausolus ) , Colossus of Rhodes , and the Lighthouse of Alexandria as depicted by 16th - century Dutch artist Maarten van Heemskerck .  Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity to the present day , to catalogue the world 's most spectacular natural wonders and manmade structures .   The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list of the most remarkable creations of classical antiquity ; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in Mesopotamia . The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty , and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently , plus the sun and moon . Many similar lists have been made .

Their writings have not survived , except as references .   The classic seven wonders were :    Colossus of Rhodes   Great Pyramid of Giza   Hanging Gardens of Babylon   Lighthouse of Alexandria   Mausoleum at Halicarnassus   Statue of Zeus at Olympia   Temple of Artemis at Ephesus    The only ancient world wonder that still exists is the Great Pyramid of Giza .   Lists from other eras   In the 19th and early 20th centuries , some writers wrote their own lists with names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages , Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages , Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind , and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages . However , it is unlikely that these lists originated in the Middle Ages , because the word `` medieval '' was not invented until the Enlightenment - era , and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century . Brewer 's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as `` later list ( s ) '' , suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages .   Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Medieval Ages but were well known .   Typically representative are :    Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa   Colosseum   Great Wall of China   Hagia Sophia   Leaning Tower of Pisa   Porcelain Tower of Nanjing   Stonehenge    Other sites sometimes included on such lists :    Cairo Citadel   Cluny Abbey   Ely Cathedral   Taj Mahal        Recent lists   Following in the tradition of the classical list , modern people and organisations have made their own lists of wonderful things ancient and modern . Some of the most notable lists are presented below .   American Society of Civil Engineers   In 1994 , the American Society of Civil Engineers compiled a list of Seven Wonders of the Modern World , paying tribute to the `` greatest civil engineering achievements of the 20th century '' .

USA Today 's New Seven Wonders   In November 2006 the American national newspaper USA Today and the American television show Good Morning America revealed a new list of New Seven Wonders as chosen by six judges . An eighth wonder was chosen on November 24 , 2006 from viewer feedback .

One of the many existing lists was compiled by CNN :    Aurora   Grand Canyon   Great Barrier Reef   Harbor of Rio de Janeiro   Mount Everest   Parícutin volcano   Victoria Falls    New7Wonders of the World   In 2001 an initiative was started by the Swiss corporation New7Wonders Foundation to choose the New7Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments . Twenty - one finalists were announced January 1 , 2006 . Egyptians were not happy that the only surviving original wonder , the Great Pyramid of Giza , would have to compete with the likes of the Statue of Liberty , the Sydney Opera House , and other landmarks , calling the project absurd . In response , Giza was named an honorary Candidate . The results were announced on July 7 , 2007 , in Lisbon , Portugal :     Wonder   Date of construction   Location     Great Wall of China   Since 7th century BC   China     Petra   c. 100 BC   Jordan     Christ the Redeemer   Opened October 12 , 1931   Brazil     Machu Picchu   c .

In 1989 CEDAM brought together a panel of marine scientists , including Dr. Eugenie Clark , to pick underwater areas which they considered to be worthy of protection . The results were announced at The National Aquarium in Washington DC by actor Lloyd Bridges , star of TV 's Sea Hunt :    Palau   Belize Barrier Reef   Great Barrier Reef   Deep - Sea Vents   Galápagos Islands   Lake Baikal   Northern Red Sea    Seven Wonders of the Industrial World   British author Deborah Cadbury wrote Seven Wonders of the Industrial World , a book telling the stories of seven great feats of engineering of the 19th and early 20th centuries . In 2003 , the BBC aired a seven - part docudrama exploring the same feats , with Cadbury as a producer . Each episode dramatised the construction of one of the following industrial wonders :    SS Great Eastern   Bell Rock Lighthouse   Brooklyn Bridge   London sewerage system   First Transcontinental Railroad   Panama Canal   Hoover Dam    Seven Wonders of the World film   Seven Wonders of the World is a 1956 film in which Lowell Thomas searches the world for natural and man made wonders and invites the audience to try to update the ancient Greek Wonders of the World list .   Seven Wonders of the Solar System   In a 1999 article , Astronomy magazine listed the `` Seven Wonders of the Solar System '' . This article was later made into a video .    Enceladus , a moon of Saturn   The Great red spot of Jupiter   The Asteroid belt   The surface of the Sun   The Oceans of Earth   The Rings of Saturn   Olympus Mons on Mars    Other lists of Wonders of the World   Numerous other authors and organisations have composed lists of the wonders of the world . For example :    British biographer , science writer , and novelist Ronald W. Clark published a book of man - made and natural wonders titled Wonders of the World , which lists 52 wonders , one for each week of the year .     Travel writer Howard Hillman published two books on the subject , one with 10 man - made wonders , and one with 10 natural wonders .

'' The Old City is located in East Jerusalem , which is claimed by both the State of Israel and the State of Palestine . The UN and most countries do not recognize Israel 's claim to East Jerusalem , taking the position that the final status of Jerusalem is pending future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .

       "  'document_text_clean': \"Rolling Stone 's 100 Greatest artists of All Time - wikipedia  Rolling Stone 's 100 Greatest artists of All Time   `` The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' is a special issue published by the American magazine Rolling Stone in two parts in 2004 and 2005 , and updated in 2011 . The list presented was compiled based on input from musicians , writers , and industry figures , and is focused on the rock & roll era . It predominantly features American and British musicians .   The publication also features comments written by musicians about their favorite colleagues ( e.g. , Elvis Costello on The Beatles , Janet Jackson on Tina Turner , etc . ) . Since its publication , the list has been frequently cited by many specialized and generalist publications .   Contents    1 Background   2 List statistics   3 See also   4 References   5 External links    Background ( edit )   The list , published in two issues in 2004 and 2005 and updated in 2011 , was based on the choices of a panel of 55 musicians , writers , and industry figures . As the editors explain , the artists were selected by `` their peers '' , and the list aims to be `` a broad survey of rock history '' , spanning from rock and roll , blues , indie rock , rap music and contemporary pop music .   List statistics ( edit )   In both versions of the list , the top three positions are held by The Beatles , Bob Dylan and Elvis Presley .   In 2011 , Rolling Stone published a revised edition of the list , with changes from 27th position onwards . The updated list features artists not present in the original ( including Queen , Metallica , Pink Floyd , Talking Heads , R.E.M. , Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers , and Jay - Z ) , removing a number of other artists ( including Etta James , Miles Davis , Roxy Music , N.W.A. , and Martha & The Vandellas ) .   The list consists primarily of American or British artists , with following exceptions : AC / DC ( Australia ) , Bob Marley ( Jamaica ) , Joni Mitchell ( Canada ) , Lee `` Scratch '' Perry ( Jamaica ; only in the 2005 list ) , Carlos Santana ( Mexico / US ) , U2 ( Ireland ) , and Neil Young ( Canada ) . Tina Turner , who relinquished her American citizenship after obtaining Swiss citizenship in 2013 , was still an American citizen when included in the list .   Most artists on the list were active in the 1960s and 1970s .

       "  'document_text_clean': \"List of Premier League broadcasters - wikipedia  List of Premier League broadcasters  Jump to : navigation , search  This is a list of television broadcasters which provide coverage of the Premier League , English football 's top level competition , which is the most watched league in the world . The main broadcasters in the United Kingdom are Sky Sports , who broadcast 126 of the 168 televised games in the UK , and BT Sport . The BBC shows weekly highlights of the Premier League on its Match of the Day and Match of the Day 2 programmes on Saturdays and Sundays .   The 168 UK televised games are also broadcast across the world ; the remaining 212 matches that are n't broadcast live in the UK are all broadcast elsewhere around the world . English - speaking countries ( excluding the UK ) are able to carry what is known as the ' International feed ' or ' World feed ' audio ; this is full match commentary provided by the Premier League . In Asia , and select other countries around the world , there is also a fully produced studio broadcast where pre , half time and post-match analysis is offered . This is currently hosted by John Dykes .   The 3 : 00pm ( UK time ) Saturday kick - offs are not allowed to be shown live in the UK due to the hours of 2.45 pm - 5.15 pm being ' blocked broadcasting hours ' , as requested by the FA and enforced by UEFA . In Ireland , a different situation applies ; a package of only one Saturday 3 : 00pm kick off each week ( along with one game on the final Sunday ) is sold as an addition to the UK live rights packages , this package is currently held by Sky Sports . While there is no rule prohibiting the screening of the other 3 : 00pm games in Ireland , the Premier League does not make the rights to these games available to Irish broadcasters , due to the overlap in reception that is possible in Northern Ireland and mainland England and not 's total match completely absolute live in total all interviews season the paradox that total matches live other will only be seen on streaming sites of he Premier League TV .

The JDK includes a private JVM and a few other resources to finish the development of a Java Application . Since the introduction of the Java platform , it has been by far the most widely used Software Development Kit ( SDK ) . On 17 November 2006 , Sun announced that they would release it under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) , thus making it free software . This happened in large part on 8 May 2007 , when Sun contributed the source code to the OpenJDK .     Contents  ( hide )   1 JDK contents   2 Ambiguity between a JDK and an SDK   3 Other JDKs   4 See also   5 References   6 External links      JDK contents ( edit )   The JDK has as its primary components a collection of programming tools , including :    appletviewer -- this tool can be used to run and debug Java applets without a web browser   apt -- the annotation - processing tool   extcheck -- a utility that detects JAR file conflicts   idlj -- the IDL - to - Java compiler . This utility generates Java bindings from a given Java IDL file .   jabswitch -- the Java Access Bridge . Exposes assistive technologies on Microsoft Windows systems .   java -- the loader for Java applications . This tool is an interpreter and can interpret the class files generated by the javac compiler . Now a single launcher is used for both development and deployment . The old deployment launcher , jre , no longer comes with Sun JDK , and instead it has been replaced by this new java loader .   javac -- the Java compiler , which converts source code into Java bytecode   javadoc -- the documentation generator , which automatically generates documentation from source code comments   jar -- the archiver , which packages related class libraries into a single JAR file . This tool also helps manage JAR files .   javafxpackager -- tool to package and sign JavaFX applications   jarsigner -- the jar signing and verification tool   javah -- the C header and stub generator , used to write native methods   javap -- the class file disassembler   javaws -- the Java Web Start launcher for JNLP applications   JConsole -- Java Monitoring and Management Console   jdb -- the debugger   jhat -- Java Heap Analysis Tool ( experimental )   jinfo -- This utility gets configuration information from a running Java process or crash dump . ( experimental )   jmap Oracle jmap - Memory Map -- This utility outputs the memory map for Java and can print shared object memory maps or heap memory details of a given process or core dump . ( experimental )   jmc -- Java Mission Control   jps -- Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool lists the instrumented HotSpot Java Virtual Machines ( JVMs ) on the target system . ( experimental )   jrunscript -- Java command - line script shell .   jstack -- utility that prints Java stack traces of Java threads ( experimental )   jstat -- Java Virtual Machine statistics monitoring tool ( experimental )   jstatd -- jstat daemon ( experimental )   keytool -- tool for manipulating the keystore   pack200 -- JAR compression tool   policytool -- the policy creation and management tool , which can determine policy for a Java runtime , specifying which permissions are available for code from various sources .   VisualVM -- visual tool integrating several command - line JDK tools and lightweight performance and memory profiling capabilities   wsimport -- generates portable JAX - WS artifacts for invoking a web service .   xjc -- Part of the Java API for XML Binding ( JAXB ) API . It accepts an XML schema and generates Java classes .    Experimental tools may not be available in future versions of the JDK .   The JDK also comes with a complete Java Runtime Environment , usually called a private runtime , due to the fact that it is separated from the `` regular '' JRE and has extra contents . It consists of a Java Virtual Machine and all of the class libraries present in the production environment , as well as additional libraries only useful to developers , such as the internationalization libraries and the IDL libraries .   Copies of the JDK also include a wide selection of example programs demonstrating the use of almost all portions of the Java API .   Ambiguity between a JDK and an SDK ( edit )   The JDK forms an extended subset of a software development kit ( SDK ) . It includes `` tools for developing , debugging , and monitoring Java applications '' . Oracle strongly suggests to now use the term JDK to refer to the Java SE Development Kit . The Java EE SDK is available with or without the JDK , by which they specifically mean the Java SE 7 JDK .   Other JDKs ( edit )   In addition to the most widely used JDK discussed in this article , there are other JDKs commonly available for a variety of platforms , some of which started from the Sun JDK source and some that did not . All adhere to the basic Java specifications , but often differ in explicitly unspecified areas , such as garbage collection , compilation strategies , and optimization techniques . They include :   In development or in maintenance mode :    Azul Systems Zing , low latency JDK for Linux ;   Azul Systems / OpenJDK - based Zulu for Linux , Windows , Mac OS X , embedded and the cloud ;   OpenJDK / IcedTea ;   GNU 's Classpath and GCJ ( The GNU Compiler for Java ) ;   Aicas JamaicaVM ;   IBM J9 JDK , for AIX , Linux , Windows , MVS , OS / 400 , Pocket PC , z / OS ;    Not being maintained or discontinued :    Apache Harmony   Apple 's Mac OS Runtime for Java JVM / JDK for Classic Mac OS   Blackdown Java -- Port of Sun 's JDK for Linux   Oracle Corporation 's JRockit JDK , for Windows , Linux , and Solaris ;    See also ( edit )    Free software portal   Java portal   Computer programming portal     Classpath ( Java )   Java platform   Java version history    References ( edit )    Jump up ^ `` Java SE 7 Features and Enhancements '' .

Principal photography was completed in Little Rock , Arkansas in December 2017 . It was released in the United States on March 30 , 2018 .

When informed of the decision to shut down the church and to replace it with a building to expand the school , Dave and Jude begin the process of suing the college to save St. James . Things get worse when college student Adam Richertson , a struggling Christian , in protest , tosses a brick into the church , igniting a fire that fatally wounds Jude . Reverend Dave is forced to come to grips with the loss of his dear friend . Adam is horrified by his actions and contemplates whether to confess to the crime , leading him to rediscover his faith in God .   During the lawsuit , Dave seeks the help of his estranged brother , attorney Pearce Hill , who tries to explain to Dave that it is not a case worth fighting for . Dave refuses to listen to his brother 's advice and continues the case into court . After failing to reach a settlement with the college , the trial date is set for the lawsuit . At the same time , Adam sends an anonymous text to Reverend Dave confessing to the church fire and a furious Dave assaults him when confronting him . This severely wounds his lawsuit 's case and leads to Adam being arrested and charged as a felony case .   After seeking God 's help in church through prayer , Reverend Dave eventually realizes that his case has only made things worse and that St. James is not the right church for God and his followers . He drops his lawsuit , reaches an out - of - court settlement with the college , and after talking with a repentant Adam and consulting with Jude 's family , ultimately asks to have the criminal charges against Adam dropped . He then announces to his college protesters that while St. James will be torn down , he will reopen a new church not far from the school for future followers .

Manning as Adam Richertson   Shwayze    Production ( edit )   Principal photography took place in December 2017 around Little Rock , Arkansas .   Reception ( edit )   Box Office ( edit )   In the United States and Canada , God 's Not Dead : A Light in Darkness was released on March 30 , 2018 , alongside Acrimony and Ready Player One , and was projected to gross $4 -- 6 million from 1,685 theaters in its opening weekend . It ended up debuting to just $2.6 million , finishing 12th at the box office and marking the lowest opening of the series . Deadline Hollywood noted the film suffered from being the third film of a trilogy and also said religious audiences saw the film as `` a cash grab and not a movie promoting a Christian message anymore '' , and were more inclined to go to other faith - based films in theaters like I Can Only Imagine and Paul , Apostle of Christ . It fell 58 % in its second weekend to $1.1 million , finishing 17th . By the end of its North American run the film grossed a total of $5.5 million , less than other two films grossed simply in their opening weekends ( $9.7 million and $7.6 million , respectively ) .   Critical response ( edit )   On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 13 % based on 15 reviews , and an average rating of 2.7 / 10 . On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 33 out of 100 , based on 9 critics , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews . '' Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` A -- '' on an A+ to F scale , though as with the second film , Deadline Hollywood noted that `` faith - based films have an easy time gaining an A on CinemaScore '' .

The song was originally written by Charli XCX , whom Icona Pop met several times in London . Swedish producer Patrik Berger sent Charli two beats , and she quickly wrote songs for each of them , one of which became `` I Love It '' and the other of which became her following single `` You 're the One '' . However , she later stated that she knew she would not end up releasing it herself because she could not reconcile it with her sound .   While recording `` Good for You '' with Icona Pop , Berger presented them with Charli 's work on `` I Love It '' . Band member Aino Jawo said she felt a connection to the song because it mirrored her own experiences , and the line `` You 're from the 70s but I 'm a 90s bitch '' reminded her of an older man she had known . Member Caroline Hjelt described Charli XCX 's original demo as `` more cute , in a way ... really cool and cocky '' . Icona Pop approached Swedish producer Style of Eye to make a rougher version of the track , telling him , `` We want the punkiness . We want the ' fuck it ' feeling . ''   Composition ( edit )       `` I Love It '' The song 's chorus features all three singers shouting `` I do n't care / I love it '' in unison .     Problems playing this file ? See media help .         `` I Love It ( Original Demo ) '' The original version of the song before its composition was reworked .     Problems playing this file ? See media help .     `` I Love It '' is set in common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute ( Allegro ) , and is described as an electropop and dance - pop song . It is written in A ♭ major , with an authentic cadence for the main chord progression . Billboard critic Jessica Hopper defined the instrumental by its `` swells of revving synths '' and prominent sub-bass sounds . Pitchfork writer Lindsay Zoladz commented that the song was `` basically just two - and - a-half minutes of drop '' ; colleague Larry Fitzmaurice noted the track 's maximalist approach fit the contemporary trends in electronic and pop music .   The song 's lyrics describe breaking up with an older boyfriend . In its chorus , Icona Pop and Charli XCX shout in unison `` I do n't care / I love it '' . Critics compared the song 's breakup narrative to Kelly Clarkson 's 2004 single `` Since U Been Gone '' , and journalist Chuck Eddy wrote in a piece for Spin that the track 's brattiness was similar to British band Shampoo .   Release and promotion ( edit )   `` I Love It '' was released in Sweden in May 2012 . It entered the Swedish Singles Chart the following month at number 48 , and after two months on the chart , the song peaked at number two for three consecutive weeks . After its January 2013 appearance on an episode of Girls , the song performed better in digital downloads than it had upon initial release . Ten days later it entered the Billboard Hot 100 , eventually climbing to number seven on the chart . Jawo and Hjelt 's first performance with Charli XCX happened in April 2013 , after seeing her back stage at a South by Southwest showcase where both acts were playing .   In June 2013 , several cover versions of the song entered the UK Singles Chart , including one by vlogger Venus Angelic . When Icona Pop released their version , it entered at the top of the chart , overtaking Robin Thicke 's `` Blurred Lines '' featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams .   Critical reception ( edit )   `` I Love It '' was met with positive reviews from music critics . The song placed 15th on The Village Voice 's 2012 Pazz & Jop list , and it rose to eighth place the following year . Pitchfork Media labeled it `` Best New Music '' , calling the song `` delectable , empowering , infinitely repeatable '' . Pitchfork later listed the song number 50 on its `` Top 100 Tracks of 2012 '' list . Rolling Stone placed `` I Love It '' at number 35 on its year - end list , naming it `` the Euro - slut club jam of the summer '' . Amrit Singh for Stereogum described it as `` fun '' , Heather Phares commented Jawo and Hjelt `` half - sung , half - shouted vocals and revved - up synths make the song inescapably catchy '' . Kat Bein of the Miami New Times called the song a `` feminist pop anthem '' .   Music video ( edit )   The music video for `` I Love It '' was directed by Fredrik Etoall . The video was shot in a day by friends of the band while they were in Paris . It shows Jawo and Hjelt playing a show for a crowd shouting the lyrics and dancing , with additional shots from backstage and an after - party . It also includes outdoor shots of them wearing fringed jackets that they made . Charli XCX does not appear in the video .   Track listing ( edit )        Digital download     No .

A court of appeals decides appeals from the district courts within its federal judicial circuit , and in some instances from other designated federal courts and administrative agencies .   The United States courts of appeals are considered among the most powerful and influential courts in the United States . Because of their ability to set legal precedent in regions that cover millions of Americans , the United States courts of appeals have strong policy influence on U.S. law . Moreover , because the U.S. Supreme Court chooses to review fewer than 2 % of the more than 7,000 to 8,000 cases filed with it annually , the U.S. courts of appeals serve as the final arbiter on most federal cases . The Ninth Circuit in particular is very influential , covering 20 % of the American population .   There are currently 179 judgeships on the U.S. courts of appeals authorized by Congress in 28 U.S.C. § 43 pursuant to Article III of the U.S. Constitution . These judges are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate . They have lifetime tenure , earning ( as of 2016 ) an annual salary of $215,400 .   There are thirteen U.S. courts of appeals , although there are other tribunals that have `` Court of Appeals '' in their titles , such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces , which hears appeals in court - martial cases , and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims , which reviews final decisions by the Board of Veterans ' Appeals in the Department of Veterans Affairs . The eleven numbered circuits and the D.C. Circuit are geographically defined . The thirteenth court of appeals is the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , which has nationwide jurisdiction over certain appeals based on their subject matter . All of the courts of appeals also hear appeals from some administrative agency decisions and rulemaking , with by far the largest share of these cases heard by the D.C. Circuit . The Federal Circuit hears appeals from specialized trial courts , primarily the United States Court of International Trade and the United States Court of Federal Claims , as well as appeals from the district courts in patent cases and certain other specialized matters .   Decisions of the U.S. courts of appeals have been published by the private company West Publishing in the Federal Reporter series since the courts were established . Only decisions that the courts designate for publication are included . The `` unpublished '' opinions ( of all but the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits ) are published separately in West 's Federal Appendix , and they are also available in on - line databases like LexisNexis or Westlaw . More recently , court decisions have also been made available electronically on official court websites . However , there are also a few federal court decisions that are classified for national security reasons .   The circuit with the smallest number of appellate judges is the First Circuit , and the one with the largest number of appellate judges is the geographically large and populous Ninth Circuit in the Far West . The number of judges that the U.S. Congress has authorized for each circuit is set forth by law in 28 U.S.C. § 44 , while the places where those judges must regularly sit to hear appeals are prescribed in 28 U.S.C. § 48 .   Although the courts of appeals are frequently called `` circuit courts '' , they should not be confused with the former United States circuit courts , which were active from 1789 to 1911 , during the time when long - distance transportation was much less available , and which were primarily first - level federal trial courts that moved periodically from place to place in `` circuits '' in order to serve the dispersed population in towns and the smaller cities that existed then . The current `` courts of appeals '' system was established in the Judiciary Act of 1891 , also known as the Evarts Act .

Only courts with original jurisdiction hold trials and thus determine punishments ( in criminal cases ) and remedies ( in civil cases ) . Instead , appeals courts review decisions of trial courts for errors of law . Accordingly , an appeals court considers only the record ( that is , the papers the parties filed and the transcripts and any exhibits from any trial ) from the trial court , and the legal arguments of the parties . These arguments , which are presented in written form and can range in length from dozens to hundreds of pages , are known as briefs . Sometimes lawyers are permitted to add to their written briefs with oral arguments before the appeals judges . At such hearings , only the parties ' lawyers speak to the court .   The rules that govern the procedure in the courts of appeals are the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure . In a court of appeals , an appeal is almost always heard by a `` panel '' of three judges who are randomly selected from the available judges ( including senior judges and judges temporarily assigned to the circuit ) . Some cases , however , receive an en banc hearing . Except in the Ninth Circuit Courts , the en banc court consists of all of the circuit judges who are on active status , but it does not include the senior or assigned judges ( except that under some circumstances , a senior judge may participate in an en banc hearing when he or she participated at an earlier stage of the same case ) .   Many decades ago , certain classes of federal court cases held the right of an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States . That is , one of the parties in the case could appeal a decision of a court of appeals to the Supreme Court , and it had to accept the case . The right of automatic appeal for most types of decisions of a court of appeals was ended by an Act of Congress , the Judiciary Act of 1925 . This law was urged by Chief Justice William Howard Taft , and it also reorganized many other things in the federal court system .   The current procedure is that a party in a case may apply to the Supreme Court to review a ruling of the circuit court . This is called petitioning for a writ of certiorari , and the Supreme Court may choose , in its sole discretion , to review any lower court ruling . In extremely rare cases , the Supreme Court may grant the writ of certiorari before the judgment is rendered by the court of appeals , thereby reviewing the lower court 's ruling directly . Certiorari before judgment was granted in the Watergate scandal - related case , United States v. Nixon , and in the 2005 decision involving the Federal Sentencing Guidelines , United States v. Booker .   A court of appeals may also pose questions to the Supreme Court for a ruling in the midst of reviewing a case . This procedure was formerly used somewhat commonly , but now it is quite rare . The Second Circuit , sitting en banc , attempted to use this procedure in the case United States v. Penaranda , as a result of the Supreme Court 's decision in Blakely v. Washington , but the Supreme Court dismissed the question after resolving the same issue in another case , which had come before the Court through the standard procedure . The last instance of the Supreme Court accepting a set of questions and answering them was in a case in 1982 .   A court of appeals may convene a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases directly from the bankruptcy court of its circuit . As of 2008 , only the First , Sixth , Eighth , Ninth , and Tenth Circuits have established a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel . Those circuits that do not have a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel have their bankruptcy appeals heard by the District Court .   Courts of appeals decisions , unlike those of the lower federal courts , establish binding precedents . Other federal courts in that circuit must , from that point forward , follow the appeals court 's guidance in similar cases , regardless of whether the trial judge thinks that the case should be decided differently .   Federal and state laws can and do change from time to time , depending on the actions of Congress and the state legislatures . Therefore , the law that exists at the time of the appeal might be different from the law that existed at the time of the events that are in controversy under civil or criminal law in the case at hand . A court of appeals applies the law as it exists at the time of the appeal ; otherwise , it would be handing down decisions that would be instantly obsolete , and this would be a waste of time and resources , since such decisions could not be cited as precedent . `` ( A ) court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision , unless doing so would result in manifest injustice , or there is statutory direction or some legislative history to the contrary . ''   However , the above rule can not apply in criminal cases if the effect of applying the newer law would be to create an ex post facto law to the detriment of the defendant .   Attorneys ( edit )   In order to serve as counsel in a case appealed to a circuit court the attorney must be admitted to the bar of that circuit . Admission to the bar of a circuit court is granted as a matter of course to any attorney who is admitted to practice law in any state of the United States . The attorney submits an application , pays a fee , and takes the oath of admission . Local practice varies as to whether the oath is given in writing or in open court before a judge of the circuit , and most courts of appeals allow the applicant attorney to choose which method he or she prefers .   Nomenclature ( edit )   When the courts of appeals were created in 1891 , one was created for each of the nine circuits then existing , and each court was named the `` United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit '' . When a court of appeals was created for the District of Columbia in 1893 , it was named the `` Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' , and it was renamed to the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' in 1934 . In 1948 , Congress renamed all of the courts of appeals then existing to their current formal names : the court of appeals for each numbered circuit was named the `` United States Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit '' , and the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' became the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit '' . The Tenth Circuit was created in 1929 by subdividing the existing Eighth Circuit , and the Eleventh Circuit was created in 1981 by subdividing the existing Fifth Circuit . The Federal Circuit was created in 1982 by the merger of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims .   Judicial councils ( edit )  Main article : Judicial council ( United States )  Judicial councils are panels in each circuit that are charged with making `` necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice '' within their circuits . Among their responsibilities is judicial discipline , the formulation of circuit policy , the implementation of policy directives received from the Judicial Conference of the United States , and the annual submission of a report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts on the number and nature of orders entered during the year that relate to judicial misconduct . Judicial councils consist of the chief judge of the circuit and an equal number of circuit judges and district judges of the circuit .

Each circuit court consisted of two Supreme Court justices and the local district judge ; the three circuits existed solely for the purpose of assigning the justices to a group of circuit courts . Some districts ( generally the ones most difficult for an itinerant justice to reach ) did not have a circuit court ; in these districts the district court exercised the original jurisdiction of a circuit court . As new states were admitted to the Union , Congress often did not create circuit courts for them for a number of years .   The Midnight Judges Act reorganized the districts into six circuits , and created circuit judgeships so that Supreme Court justices would no longer have to ride circuit . This Act , however , was repealed in March 1802 , and Congress provided that the former circuit courts would be revived as of July 1 of that year . But it then passed the new Judiciary Act of 1802 in April , so that the revival of the old courts never took effect . The 1802 Act restored circuit riding , but with only one justice to a circuit ; it therefore created six new circuits , but with slightly different compositions than the 1801 Act . These six circuits later were augmented by others . Until 1866 , each new circuit ( except the short - lived California Circuit ) was accompanied by a newly created Supreme Court seat .

This season featured ten All - Star contestants , selected from the show 's second season through to its seventh season , who competed to be inducted into the `` Drag Race Hall of Fame '' .   A new twist was revealed for this season , changing the format of the show . In previous seasons , the bottom two queens had to `` Lip - sync for their Life '' to avoid elimination . This season had the top two performing queens of the challenge `` Lip - sync for their Legacy , '' with the winner of the lip - sync earning $10,000 and choosing which one of the bottom queens gets eliminated . The prizes for the winner were a one - year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $100,000 .   The winner of the second season of RuPaul 's Drag Race All Stars was Alaska , with Detox and Katya being the runners - up .

The President presides over the sessions of the General Assembly .   Miroslav Lajčák of Slovakia has been elected as the United Nations General Assembly President of its 72nd session beginning in September 2017 .

The session of the assembly is scheduled for every year starting in September -- any special , or emergency special , assemblies over the next year will be headed by the President of the UN General Assembly .   The presidency rotates annually between the five geographic groups : African , Asia - Pacific , Eastern European , Latin American and Caribbean , and Western European and other States .   Because of their powerful stature globally , some of the largest , most powerful countries have never held the presidency , such as the People 's Republic of China , France , Japan , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the United States . In particular , it is customary that no permanent member of the United Nations Security Council ever serves as General Assembly president .   The only country that had a national elected as President of the United Nations General Assembly twice is Argentina ; all the other member states had been represented only once by their nationals holding this office . This does not include special and emergency special sessions of the General Assembly .

Count Dracula is an undead , centuries - old vampire , and a Transylvanian nobleman who claims to be a Székely descended from Attila the Hun . He inhabits a decaying castle in the Carpathian Mountains near the Borgo Pass . Unlike the vampires of Eastern European folklore , which are portrayed as repulsive , corpse - like creatures , Dracula wears a veneer of aristocratic charm . In his conversations with Jonathan Harker , he reveals himself as deeply proud of his boyar heritage and nostalgic for the past , which he admits have become only a memory of heroism , honour and valour in modern times .   Early life ( edit )   Details of his early life are obscure , but it is mentioned `` he was in life a most wonderful man . Soldier , statesman , and alchemist ( which was the highest development of the science knowledge of his time ) . He had a mighty brain , a learning beyond compare , and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse ... there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay . '' He studied the black arts at the academy of Scholomance in the Carpathian Mountains , overlooking the town of Sibiu ( also known as Hermannstadt ) and has a deep knowledge of alchemy and magic . Taking up arms , as befitting his rank and status as a voivode , he led troops against the Turks across the Danube . According to his nemesis Abraham Van Helsing , `` He must indeed have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk , over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey - land . If it be so , then was he no common man : for in that time , and for centuries after , he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning , as well as the bravest of the sons of the land beyond the forest . '' Dead and buried in a great tomb in the chapel of his castle , Dracula returns from death as a vampire and lives for several centuries in his castle with three terrifyingly beautiful female vampires beside him .   Narrative ( edit )  Cover of Dracula 's Guest , a collection of short stories authored by Bram Stoker Short story ( edit )  In `` Dracula 's Guest '' , the narrative follows an unnamed Englishman traveller as he wanders around Munich before leaving for Transylvania . It is Walpurgis Night and the young Englishman foolishly leaves his hotel , in spite of the coachman 's warnings , and wanders through a dense forest alone . Along the way , he feels that he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger ( possibly Count Dracula ) .   The short story climaxes in an old graveyard , where the Englishman encounters a sleeping female vampire called Countess Dolingen in a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven into it . This malevolent and beautiful vampire awakens from her marble bier to conjure a snowstorm before being struck by lightning and returning to her eternal prison . However , the Englishman 's troubles are not quite over , as he is dragged away by an unseen force and rendered unconscious . He awakens to find a `` gigantic '' wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat ; however , the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives . When the Englishman is finally taken back to his hotel , a telegram awaits him from his expectant host Dracula , with a warning about `` dangers from snow and wolves and night '' .  Novel ( edit )  As the Dracula novel begins in the late 19th century , Dracula acts on a long - contemplated plan for world domination , and infiltrates London to begin his reign of terror . He summons Jonathan Harker , a newly qualified English solicitor , to provide legal support for a real estate transaction overseen by Harker 's employer . Dracula at first charms Harker with his cordiality and historical knowledge , and even rescues him from the clutches of the three female vampires in the castle . In truth , however , Dracula merely wishes to keep Harker alive long enough to complete the legal transaction and to learn as much as possible about England .   Dracula leaves his castle and boards a Russian ship , the Demeter , taking along with him 50 boxes of Transylvanian soil , which he needs in order to regain his strength and rest during daylight . During the voyage to Whitby , a coastal town in northern England , he sustains himself on the ship 's crew members . Only one body is later found , that of the captain , who is found tied up to the ship 's helm . The captain 's log is recovered and tells of strange events that had taken place during the ship 's journey . Dracula leaves the ship in the form of a dog .   Soon the Count is menacing Harker 's fiancée , Wilhelmina `` Mina '' Murray , and her friend , Lucy Westenra . There is also a notable link between Dracula and Renfield , a patient in an insane asylum overseen by John Seward , who is compelled to consume insects , spiders , birds , and other creatures -- in ascending order of size -- in order to absorb their `` life force '' . Renfield acts as a kind of sensor , reacting to Dracula 's proximity and supplying clues accordingly . Dracula begins to visit Lucy 's bed chamber on a nightly basis , draining her of blood while simultaneously infecting her with the curse of vampirism . Not knowing the cause for Lucy 's deterioration , her three suitors - Seward , Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris - call upon Seward 's mentor , the Dutch doctor Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing soon deduces her condition 's supernatural origins , but does not speak out . Despite an attempt at keeping the vampire at bay with garlic , Dracula attacks Lucy 's house one final time , killing her mother and transforming Lucy herself into one of the undead .   Harker escapes Dracula 's castle and returns to England , barely alive and deeply traumatized . On Seward 's suggestion , Mina seeks Van Helsing 's assistance in assessing Harker 's health . She reads his journal and passes it along to Van Helsing . This unfolds the first clue to the identity of Lucy 's assailant , which later prompts Mina to collect all of the events of Dracula 's appearance in news articles , saved letters , newspaper clippings and the journals of each member of the group . This assists the group in investigating Dracula 's movements and later discovering that Renfield 's behaviour is directly influenced by Dracula . They then discover that Dracula has purchased a residence just next door to Seward 's . The group gathers intelligence to track the location of Dracula for the purpose of destroying him .  Max Schreck as Count Orlok , the first confirmed cinematic representation of Dracula ( in Nosferatu , 1922 ) .  After the undead Lucy attacks several children , Van Helsing , Seward , Holmwood and Morris enter her crypt and destroy her to save her soul . Later , Harker joins them and the party work to discover Dracula 's intentions . Harker aids the party in tracking down the locations of the boxes to the various residences of Dracula and discovers that Dracula purchased multiple real estate properties ' over the counter ' throughout the North , South , East and West sides of London under the alias ' Count De Ville ' . Dracula 's main plan was to move each of his 50 boxes of earth to his various properties in order to arrange multiple lairs throughout and around the perimeter of London .   The party pries open each of the graves , places wafers of Sacramental bread within each of them , and seals them shut . This deprives the Count of his ability to seek safety in those boxes . Dracula gains entry into Seward 's residence by coercing an invitation out of Renfield . As he attempts to enter the room in which Harker and Mina are staying , Renfield tries to stop him ; Dracula then mortally wounds him . With his dying breath , Renfield tells Seward and Van Helsing that Dracula is after Mina. Van Helsing and Seward discover Dracula biting Mina then forcing her to drink his blood . The group repel Dracula using crucifixes and sacramental bread , forcing Dracula to flee by turning into a dark vapor . The party continue to hunt Dracula to search for his remaining lairs . Although Dracula 's ' baptism ' of Mina grants him a telepathic link to her , it backfires when Van Helsing hypnotizes Mina and uses her supernatural link with Dracula to track him as he flees back to Transylvania .   The heroes follow Dracula back to Transylvania , and in a climactic battle with Dracula 's gypsy bodyguards , finally destroy him . Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart to kill him , Mina 's narrative describes his decapitation by Harker 's kukri while Morris simultaneously pierced his heart with a Bowie knife ( Mina Harker 's Journal , 6 November , Dracula Chapter 27 ) . His body then turns into dust , but not before Mina sees an expression of peace on his face .   Characteristics ( edit )   Although early in the novel Dracula dons a mask of cordiality , he often flies into fits of rage when his plans are frustrated . When the three vampire women who live in his castle attempt to seduce Jonathan Harker , Dracula physically assaults one and ferociously berates them for their insubordination . He then relents and talks to them more kindly , telling them that he does indeed love each of them .   He has an appreciation for ancient architecture , and when purchasing a home he prefers them to be aged , saying `` A new home would kill me '' , and that to make a new home habitable to him would take a century .   Dracula is very proud of his warrior heritage , proclaiming his pride to Harker on how the Székely people are infused with the blood of heroes . He also expresses an interest in the history of the British Empire , speaking admiringly of its people . He has a somewhat primal and predatory worldview ; he pities ordinary humans for their revulsion to their darker impulses . He is not without human emotions , however ; he often says that he too can love .   Though usually portrayed as having a strong Eastern European accent , the original novel only specifies that his spoken English is excellent , though strangely toned .   His appearance varies in age . He is described early in the novel as thin , with a long white mustache , pointed ears and sharp teeth . It is also noted later in the novel ( Chapter 11 subsection `` The Escaped Wolf '' ) by a zookeeper who sees him that he has a hooked nose and a pointed beard with a streak of white in it . He is dressed all in black and has hair on his palms . Jonathan Harker described him as an old man , `` cruel looking '' and giving an effect of `` extraordinary pallor '' . When angered , the Count showed his true bestial nature , his blue eyes flaming red .   I saw ... Count Dracula ... with red light of triumph in his eyes , and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of .  -- Jonathan Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 4  As the novel progresses , Dracula is described as taking on a more and more youthful appearance . After Harker strikes him with a shovel , he is left with a scar on his forehead which he bears throughout the course of the novel .   Dracula also possesses great wealth and having Romani people in his homeland who are loyal to him as servants and protectors .   Powers and weaknesses ( edit )   Count Dracula is portrayed in the novel using many different supernatural abilities , and is believed to have gained his abilities through dealings with the Devil . Chapter 18 of the novel describes many of the abilities , limitations and weaknesses of Dracula and vampires in particular . Dracula has superhuman strength which , according to Van Helsing , is equivalent to that of 20 strong men . He does not cast a shadow or have a reflection from mirrors . He is immune to conventional means of attack ; a sailor tries to stab him in the back with a knife , but the blade goes through his body as though it is air . Why Harker 's and Morris ' physical attacks are able to harm him in other parts of the book is never explained although it is noteworthy that the failed stabbing by the sailor occurred at night and the successful attacks were during daylight hours . The Count can defy gravity to a certain extent and possesses superhuman agility , able to climb vertical surfaces upside down in a reptilian manner . He can travel onto `` unhallowed '' ground such as the graves of suicides and those of his victims . He has powerful hypnotic , telepathic and illusionary abilities . He also has the ability to `` within limitations '' vanish and reappear elsewhere at will . If he knows the path , he can come out from anything or into anything regardless of how close it is bound even if it is fused with fire .   He has amassed cunning and wisdom throughout centuries , and he is unable to die by the mere passing of time alone .   He can command animals such as rats , owls , bats , moths , foxes and wolves . However , his control over these animals is limited , as seen when the party first enters his house in London . Although Dracula is able to summon thousands of rats to swarm and attack the group , Seward summons a pack of hounds to devour the rats . The rats are so frightened of the dogs that they flee , and any control which Dracula had over them is gone .   Dracula can also manipulate the weather and , within his range , is able to direct the elements , such as storms , fog and mist .   Shapeshifting ( edit )   Dracula can shapeshift at will , able to grow and become small , his featured forms in the novel being that of a bat , a wolf , a large dog and a fog or mist . When the moonlight is shining , he can travel as elemental dust within its rays . He is able to pass through tiny cracks or crevices while retaining his human form or in the form of a vapour ; described by Van Helsing as the ability to slip through a hairbreadth space of a tomb door or coffin . This is also an ability used by his victim Lucy as a vampire . When the party breaks into her tomb , they dismantle the secured coffin to find it completely empty ; her corpse being no longer located within .   Vampirism ( edit )   One of Dracula 's most mysterious powers is the ability to turn others into vampires by biting them . According to Van Helsing :   When they become such , there comes with the change the curse of immortality ; they can not die , but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world . For all that die from the preying of the Un-dead become themselves Un-dead , and prey on their kind . And so the circle goes on ever widening , like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water . Friend Arthur , if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die , or again , last night when you open your arms to her , you would in time , when you had died , have become nosferatu , as they call it in Eastern europe , and would for all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have filled us with horror .  -- Dr. Seward 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 16  The vampire bite itself does not cause death . It is the method vampires use to drain blood of the victim and to increase their influence over them . This is described by Van Helsing :   The Nosferatu do not die like the bees when they sting once . He is only stronger , and being stronger , have yet more power to work evil .  -- Mina Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 18  Victims who are bitten by a vampire and do not die , are hypnotically influenced by them :   Those children whose blood she suck are not yet so much worse ; but if she live on , Un-Dead , more and more lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her .  -- Mina Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 18  Van Helsing later describes the aftermath of a bitten victim when the vampire has been killed :   But if she die in truth , then all cease ; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear , and they go back to their plays unknowing of whatever has been .  -- Mina Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 18  As Dracula slowly drains Lucy 's blood , she dies from acute blood loss and later transforms into a vampire , despite the efforts of Seward and Van Helsing to provide her with blood transfusions .   He is aided by powers of necromancy and divination of the dead , that all who die by his hand may reanimate and do his bidding .  Bloodletting ( edit )  Dracula requires no other sustenance but fresh human blood , which has the effect of rejuvenating him and allowing him to grow younger . His power is drawn from the blood of others , and he can not survive without it . Although drinking blood can rejuvenate his youth and strength , it does not give him the ability to regenerate ; months after being struck on the head by a shovel , he still bears a scar from the impact .   Dracula 's preferred victims are women . Harker states that he believes Dracula has a state of fasting as well as a state of feeding . Dracula does state to Mina however that exerting his abilities caused a desire to feed .  Vampire 's baptism of blood ( edit )  Count Dracula is depicted as the `` King Vampire '' , and can control other vampires . To punish Mina and the party for their efforts against him , Dracula bites her on at least three occasions . He also forces her to drink his blood ; this act curses her with the effects of vampirism and gives him a telepathic link to her thoughts . However , hypnotism was only able to be done before dawn . Van Helsing refers to the act of drinking blood by both the vampire and the victim `` the Vampire 's Baptism of Blood '' .     ``   you , their best beloved one , are now to me , flesh of my flesh , blood of my blood , kin of my kin , my bountiful wine - press for a while , and shall be later on my companion and my helper . You shall be avenged in turn , for not one of them but shall minister to your needs . But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done . You have aided in thwarting me . Now you shall come to my call . When my brain says ' Come ! ' to you , you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding .   ''     The effects changes Mina ' physically and mentally over time . A few moments after Dracula attacks her , Van Helsing takes a wafer of sacramental bread and places it on her forehead to bless her ; when the bread touches her skin , it burns her and leaves a scar on her forehead . Her teeth start growing longer but do not grow sharper . She begins to lose her appetite , feeling repulsed by normal food , begins to sleep more and more during the day ; can not wake unless at sunset and stops writing in her diary . When Van Helsing later crumbles the same bread in a circle around her , she is unable to cross or leave the circle , discovering a new form of protection .   Dracula 's death can release the curse on any living victim of eventual transformation into vampire . However , Van Helsing reveals that were he to successfully escape , his continued existence would ensure that even if he did not victimize Mina further , she would transform into a vampire upon her eventual natural death .   Limitations of his powers ( edit )   Dracula is much less powerful in daylight and is only able to shift his form at dawn , noon , and dusk ( he can shift his form freely at night or if he is at his grave ) . The sun is not fatal to him , as sunlight does not burn and destroy him upon contact , though most of his abilities cease .   The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course . Until it sets to - night , that monster must retain whatever form he now has . He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope . He can not melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies . If he go through a doorway , he must open the door like a mortal .  -- Johnathan Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 22  His power ceases , as does that all of all evil things , at the coming of the day . Only at certain times can he have limited freedom . If he be not at the place whither he is bound , he can only change himself at noon or exact sunrise or sunset .  -- Mina Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 18  He is also limited in his ability to travel , as he can only cross running water at low or high tide . Due to this , he is unable to fly across a river in the form of a bat or mist or even by himself board a boat or step off a boat onto a dock unless he is physically carried over with assistance . He is also unable to enter a place unless invited to do so by someone of the household , even a visitor ; once invited , he can enter and leave the premises at will .   Weaknesses ( edit )  Thirst ( edit )  Dracula has a bloodlust which he is seemingly unable to control . At the sight of blood he becomes enveloped in a demonic fury which is fueled by the need to feed . Other adaptations call this uncontrollable state ' the thirst ' .  Religious symbolism ( edit )  There are items which afflict him to the point he has no power and can even calm him from his insatiable appetite for blood . He is repulsed by garlic , as well as sacred items and symbols such as crucifixes , and sacramental bread .   at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little , and the blood was trickling over my chin . I laid down the razor , turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster . When the Count saw my face , his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury , and he suddenly made a grab at my throat . I drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix . It made an instant change in him , for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there .  -- Jonathan Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 2  Placing the branch of a wild rose upon the top of his coffin will render him unable to escape it ; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin could kill him so that he remain true - dead .   Mountain Ash is also described as a form of protection from a vampire although the effects are unknown . This was believed to be used as protection against evil spirits and witches during the Victorian era .  Death - sleep ( edit )  The state of rest to which vampires are prone to during times of day is described in the novel as a deathlike sleep where the vampire sleeps open - eyed , is unable to awaken or move , yet also may be unaware of any presence of individuals who may be trespassing . Dracula is portrayed as being active in daylight at least once in order to pursue a victim . Dracula also purchases many properties throughout London ' over the counter ' which shows that he does have the ability to have some type of presence in daylight .     ``   on a pile of newly dug earth , lay the Count ! He was either dead or asleep . I could not say which , for eyes were open and stony , but without the glassiness of death , and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor . The lips were as red as ever . But there was no sign of movement , no pulse , no breath , no beating of the heart . I bent over him , and tried to find any sign of life , but in vain ... I thought he might have the keys on him , but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes , and in them dead though they were , such a look of hate , though unconscious of me or my presence , that I fled from the place , and leaving the Count 's room by the window   ''     He requires Transylvanian soil to be nearby to him in a foreign land or to be entombed within his coffin within Transylvania in order to successfully rest ; otherwise , he will be unable to recover his strength . This has forced him to transport many boxes of Transylvanian earth to each of his residences in London . It should be noted however that he is most powerful when he is within his Earth - Home , Coffin - Home , Hell - Home , or any place unhallowed .   Further , if Dracula or any vampire has had their fill in blood upon feeding , they will be caused to rest in this dead state even longer than usual .   Other abilities ( edit )   While universally feared by the local people of Transylvania and even beyond , Dracula commands the loyalty of gypsies and a band of Slovaks who transport his boxes on their way to London and to serve as an armed convoy bringing his coffin back to his castle . The Slovaks and gypsies appear to know his true nature , for they laugh at Harker when he tries to communicate his plight , and betray Harker 's attempt to send a letter through them by giving it to the Count .   Dracula seems to be able to hold influence over people with mental disorders , such as Renfield , who is never bitten but who worships Dracula , referring to him over the course of the novel as `` Master '' and `` Lord '' . Dracula also afflicts Lucy with chronic sleepwalking , putting her into a trance - like state that allows them not only to submit to his will but also seek him and satisfy his need to feed .   Dracula 's powers and weaknesses vary greatly in the many adaptations . Previous and subsequent vampires from different legends have had similar vampire characteristics .   Character development subsequent to the novel ( edit )  Main article : Dracula in popular culture Statue of Béla Lugosi as Count Dracula , at the Hollywood Wax Museum  Dracula is one of the most famous characters in popular culture . He has been portrayed by more actors in more visual media adaptations of the novel than any other horror character . Actors who have played him include Max Schreck , Béla Lugosi , John Carradine , Christopher Lee , Francis Lederer , Denholm Elliott , Jack Palance , Louis Jourdan , Frank Langella , Klaus Kinski , Gary Oldman , Leslie Nielsen , George Hamilton , Keith - Lee Castle , Gerard Butler , Duncan Regehr , Richard Roxburgh , Marc Warren , Rutger Hauer , Stephen Billington , Thomas Kretschmann , Dominic Purcell , Luke Evans and Lon Chaney Jr ... In 2003 , Count Dracula , as portrayed by Lugosi in the 1931 film , was named as the 33rd greatest movie villain by the AFI .  Gary Oldman as Dracula in Bram Stoker 's Dracula .  The character is closely associated with the western cultural archetype of the vampire , and remains a popular Halloween costume .    Count Dracula appears in Mad Monster Party ? voiced by Allen Swift . This version is shown to be wearing a monocle . Count Dracula is among the monsters that Baron Boris von Frankenstein invites to the Isle of Evil in order to show off the secret of total destruction and announce his retirement from the Worldwide Organization of Monsters .   In Sesame Street , there is a character called Count von Count who was based on Bela Lugosi 's interpretation of Count Dracula and Jack Davis ' design for Dracula from Mad Monster Party ? .   Count Dracula appears in Mad Mad Mad Monsters ( a `` prequel of sorts '' to Mad Monster Party ? ) voiced again by Allen Swift . He and his son are invited by Baron Henry von Frankenstein to attend the wedding of Frankenstein 's Monster and its mate at the Transylvania Astoria Hotel .   Dracula is the primary antagonist of the Castlevania video game series and the main protagonist of the Lords of Shadow reboot series .   Dracula appears as the lead character of Dracula the Un-dead , a novel by Stoker 's great - grand nephew Dacre presented as a sequel to the original .   Count Dracula is the main character of the Hotel Transylvania franchise , voiced by Adam Sandler .    Modern and postmodern analyses of the character ( edit )  Portrait of Vlad III Dracula .  Already in 1958 , Cecil Kirtly proposed that Count Dracula shared his personal past with the historical Transylvanian - born Voivode Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia , also known as Vlad the Impaler or Vlad Țepeș . Following the publication of In Search of Dracula by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally in 1972 , this supposed connection attracted much popular attention . This work argued that Bram Stoker based his Dracula on Vlad the Impaler .   Historically , the name `` Dracula '' is the given name of Vlad Țepeș ' family , a name derived from a secret fraternal order of knights called the Order of the Dragon , founded by Sigismund of Luxembourg ( king of Hungary and Bohemia , and Holy Roman Emperor ) to uphold Christianity and defend the Empire against the Ottoman Turks . Vlad II Dracul , father of Vlad III , was admitted to the order around 1431 because of his bravery in fighting the Turks and was dubbed Dracul ( Dragon ) thus his son became Dracula ( son of the dragon ) . From 1431 onward , Vlad II wore the emblem of the order and later , as ruler of Wallachia , his coinage bore the dragon symbol .   Stoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on Romanian history , and chose this to replace the name ( Count Wampyr ) that he had originally intended to use for his villain . However , some Dracula scholars , led by Elizabeth Miller , have questioned the depth of this connection as early as 1998 . They argue that Stoker in fact knew little of the historic Vlad III , Vlad the Impaler and that he used only the name `` Dracula '' and some miscellaneous scraps of Romanian history . As well , and there are no comments about Vlad III in the author 's working notes .   While having a conversation with Jonathan Harker in Chapter 3 , Dracula refers to his own background , and these speeches show elements which Stoker directly copied from Wilkinson 's book . Stoker mentions the Voivode of the Dracula race who fought against the Turks after the defeat in the Battle of Kosovo , and was later betrayed by his brother , historical facts which unequivocally point to Vlad III , described as `` Voïvode Dracula '' by Wilkinson :   Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground ? This was a Dracula indeed ! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother , when he had fallen , sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them ! Was it not this Dracula , indeed , who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey - land ; who , when he was beaten back , came again , and again , though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered , since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph ! ( Chapter 3 , pp. 19 )   The Count 's intended identity is later commented by Professor Van Helsing , referring to a letter from his friend Arminius :   He must , indeed , have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk , over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey - land . ( Chapter 18 , pp. 145 )   This indeed encourages the reader to identify the Count with the Voivode Dracula first mentioned by him in Chapter 3 , the one betrayed by his brother : Vlad III Dracula , betrayed by his brother Radu the Handsome , who had chosen the side of the Turks . But as noted by the Dutch author Hans Corneel de Roos , in Chapter 25 , Van Helsing and Mina drop this rudimentary connection to Vlad III and instead describe the Count 's personal past as that of `` that other of his race '' who lived `` in a later age '' . By smoothly exchanging Vlad III for a nameless double , Stoker avoided that his main character could be unambiguously linked to a historical person traceable in any history book .   Similarly , the novelist did not want to disclose the precise site of the Count 's residence , Castle Dracula . As confirmed by Stoker 's own handwritten research notes , the novelist had a specific location for the Castle in mind while writing the narrative : an empty mountain top in the Transylvanian Kelemen Alps near the former border with Moldavia . Efforts to promote the Poenari Castle ( ca . 200 km away from the novel 's place of action near the Borgo Pass ) as the `` real Castle Dracula '' have no basis in Stoker 's writing ; Stoker did not know this building . Regarding the Bran Castle near Brașov , Stoker possibly saw an illustration of Castle Bran ( Törzburg ) in Charles Boner 's book on Transylvania . Although Stoker may have been inspired by its romantic appearance , neither Boner , nor Mazuchelli nor Crosse ( who also mention Terzburg or Törzburg ) associate it with Vlad III ; for the site of his fictitious Castle Dracula , Stoker preferred an empty mountain top .   Furthermore , Stoker 's detailed notes reveal that the novelist was very well aware of the ethnic and geo - political differences between the `` Roumanians '' or `` Wallachs '' / `` Wallachians '' , descendants of the Dacians , and the Székelys or Szeklers , allies of the Magyars or Hungarians , whose interests were opposed to that of the Wallachians . In the novel 's original typewritten manuscript , the Count speaks of throwing off the `` Austrian yoke '' , which corresponds to the Szekler political point of view . This expression is crossed out , however , and replaced by `` Hungarian yoke '' ( as appearing in the printed version ) , which matches the historical perspective of the Wallachians . This has been interpreted by some to mean that Stoker opted for the Wallachian , not the Szekler interpretation , thus lending more consistency to the Romanian identity of his Count : although not identical with Vlad III , the Vampire is portrayed as one of the `` Dracula race '' .

Originally meant to be a temporary character , Andy was so likable that producers asked Pratt back as a series regular . He appears in the first season as Ann Perkins ' unemployed slacker boyfriend , then takes a job as a shoe - shiner at Pawnee City Hall in the second season . Andy eventually marries April Ludgate and is later promoted to Leslie Knope 's assistant . Pratt was credited as a guest star for the first season , despite appearing in every episode ; he is part of the main cast for every season after season one .   Andy is one of the few starring characters not to appear in every episode , as he was absent for a multi-episode arc in season six while Pratt was filming Guardians of the Galaxy .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Background   2 Storyline   2.1 Season one   2.2 Season two   2.3 Season three   2.4 Season four   2.5 Season five   2.6 Season six   2.7 Season seven     3 Development   4 Controversy   5 References      Background ( edit )   At the start of the series , Andy Dwyer is dating Ann Perkins . Ann matured faster than Andy did ; while Ann entered into a career in nursing , Andy remained lazy and spoiled .   Andy remained unemployed after school but was the lead singer and guitarist for his rock band , which underwent numerous name changes ( starting with `` Teddy Bear Suicide '' prior to the show 's first season ) , including `` MouseRat , '' `` God Hates Figs , '' `` Department of Homeland Obscurity , '' `` Flames For Flames , '' `` Muscle Confusion , '' `` Nothing Rhymes With Orange '' ( then , `` Everything Rhymes With Orange '' ) , `` Punch Face Champions , '' `` Rad Wagon , '' `` Puppy Pendulum , '' `` Possum Pendulum , '' `` Penis Pendulum , '' `` Handrail Suicide , '' `` Angel Snack , '' `` Just The Tip , '' `` Jet - Black Pope , '' `` Four - Skin '' ( later `` Three - Skin '' when one member quit ) , `` MouseRat '' ( again ) , `` RatMouse '' ( without Dwyer ) , `` Scarecrow Boat , '' `` Tackleshaft '' and then `` MouseRat '' ( yet again ) .   Though absentminded and possessing an extremely short attention span , Andy is shown to have a savant - like memory . For instance , he received the highest grade the police academy had ever seen on the written entrance test , has an uncanny ability to remember movies word for word , and is able to memorize a long list of facts for his feminist college class in the episode , `` Smallest Park . '' Andy also had perfect SAT scores , but mentioned it was probably due to broken Scantron machines .   Storyline ( edit )   Season one ( edit )   Before the start of the first season , a drunken Andy fell into a large construction pit and broke both his legs while attempting to retrieve a discarded toaster from the bottom of the pit . Ann is at first unaware that Andy was drunk at the time of the fall , and the incident inspires her to attend Parks and Recreation meetings to advocate for filling in the pit . It is at these meetings that Ann first befriends Parks Deputy Director Leslie Knope .   With both of Andy 's legs in casts , Ann pampers him , bringing him food and letting him play video games all day . When the doctors inform Andy that the casts can be removed , he delays their removal for several weeks so he can continue receiving this treatment from Ann . After the casts are removed , Ann discovers the truth and furiously breaks up with Andy .   Season two ( edit )   Andy moves into a tent pitched in the pit and watches Ann , claiming to be protecting her . He makes many failed attempts to reconcile with Ann . After Mark Brendanawicz begins dating Ann , Andy grows to hate him , but pretends to like him whenever Ann is around . Andy is injured in the pit a second time when Leslie arranges to have it filled with dirt , unaware that Andy is still in the pit . Andy considers suing the town with the hopes of getting money and winning Ann back , but Leslie convinces him to settle out of court in exchange for having the pit filled in . Leslie gives Andy a job as the shoe - shiner at the Pawnee City Hall as part of his settlement . April Ludgate , the parks department intern , begins to develop a crush on Andy , but he is for a long time unaware of her feelings toward him . As time goes on , Andy begins to develop feelings for April , though he is unsure about dating her due to their age difference and his own unresolved feelings for Ann . Simultaneously , Ann begins to show similar feelings for Andy after her relationship with Mark ends . At the end of the season , having broken up with Mark , Ann kisses Andy , who does not reciprocate . This later causes him problems with April , who continues to believe he is still in love with Ann .   Season Three ( edit )   Andy has been unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with April . When she finally returns from Venezuela , she arrives with a new boyfriend , Eduardo . Leslie encourages Andy to not give up . In the episode `` Time Capsule '' , Andy befriends Eduardo at the advice of Chris Traeger . As a result , April begins hating her new boyfriend , and he moves back to Venezuela . Andy also becomes the new coach of one of the two youth basketball teams , with Ron serving as the other coach . Andy 's coaching style is much lazier than Ron 's strict style . He is also briefly Ron 's receptionist in `` Flu Season '' . In the episode `` Media Blitz '' , April leads Andy to believe that if he completes the tasks she hates every day for a month , she will consider being with him . Although she begins this as a bluff , after seeing Andy complete even the most humiliating of these tasks happily , she kisses him . In the episode `` Andy and April 's Fancy Party '' Andy reveals that he had proposed to April a day earlier after only one month of dating to which April replied , `` Fine . '' They are married at the end of the episode in a surprise ceremony .   Season four ( edit )   At the beginning of season four , Tom asks Andy to join his new company . He declines Tom 's offer and instead joins Leslie 's campaign as her assistant and head of security , a role he enjoys very much . At the end of the season , he is encouraged by April to pursue a career as a police officer as all his `` dream jobs , '' with the exception of rock star , revolve around law enforcement .   Season five ( edit )   During the fifth season , Andy continues to pursue his ambition to become a police officer and seeks help from others to better his chances of passing the police academy entrance exams . He asks Chris to help him get fit enough to pass the police physical . His marriage to April is not strained by the distance between them : they exchange care packages and he visits her in Washington , DC .   Andy earns a perfect score on the written portion of the police officers ' exam . When he fails the personality portion of the exam , he gets a rousing pep talk from Chris . Ben then gives Andy a job working with him at the Sweetum 's charity foundation .   Season six ( edit )   Andy 's role is reduced in the sixth season , as Chris Pratt was busy with other filming commitments . Andy spends the early part of season 6 in England attending to Sweetum 's charity work . Before he went to England , he loses 50 pounds after giving up beer . He briefly visits Pawnee and does not want to return to England , but April convinces him to go back . In the season finale , Andy reunites with MouseRat and sings a Li'l Sebastian memorial song at the Pawnee Unity concert .   Season seven ( edit )   Andy remains married to April Ludgate , and the two have become responsible adults , to their horror . He has a TV show on public access , The Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show , where he is knighted by Lord Edgar Covington in its final episode , and later works part - time at the National Parks service . His friendship with Tom has grown since the previous seasons . After April decides to leave for a new job in Washington , D.C. , Andy goes with her .   In a series of flash - forwards in the final episode , April and Andy ask Leslie and Ben for advice regarding the prospect of having children , which Andy very much wants but April does not . They decide to try for it and their son , Burt Snakehole Ludgate Karate Dracula Macklin Demon Jack - o - Lantern `` Jack '' Dwyer is born on Halloween 2023 . By 2025 the couple is expecting their second child .   Development ( edit )   Chris Pratt was credited as a guest star throughout the entire first season , but was promoted to the main cast in the second season . The Andy character was originally supposed to appear only in the first season , but the producers liked Pratt so much that almost immediately after casting him , they decided to make Andy a regular character .   Controversy ( edit )   In the second season , Pratt did a scene with Amy Poehler while he was naked . Poehler was not expecting this and Pratt was reprimanded for it . The take was later aired on TV . He was expected to wear skin tone briefs .

As a partial solar eclipse , it was visible on land from Nunavut in northern Canada to as far south as northern South America . In northwestern Europe and Africa , it was partially visible in the late evening . In Asia , it was visible only at the eastern extremity , the Chukchi Peninsula .  Play media Video of the eclipse second contact in Simpsonville , South Carolina . Crowd reaction is heard on audio .  Prior to this event , no solar eclipse had been visible across the entire contiguous United States since June 8 , 1918 ; not since the February 1979 eclipse had a total eclipse been visible from anywhere in the mainland United States . The path of totality touched 14 states , and the rest of the U.S. had a partial eclipse . The area of the path of totality was about 16 percent of the area of the United States , with most of this area over the ocean , not land . The event 's shadow began to cover land on the Oregon coast as a partial eclipse at 4 : 05 p.m. UTC ( 9 : 05 a.m. PDT ) , with the total eclipse beginning there at 5 : 16 p.m. UTC ( 10 : 16 a.m. PDT ) ; the total eclipse 's land coverage ended along the South Carolina coast at about 6 : 44 p.m. UTC ( 2 : 44 p.m. EDT ) . Visibility as a partial eclipse in Honolulu , Hawaii began with sunrise at 4 : 20 p.m. UTC ( 6 : 20 a.m. HST ) and ended by 5 : 25 p.m. UTC ( 7 : 25 a.m. HST ) .   This total solar eclipse marked the first such event in the smartphone and social media era in America . Information , personal communication , and photography were widely available as never before , capturing popular attention and enhancing the social experience .   Marriage proposals took place coinciding with the eclipse , and at least one wedding was also planned and took place to coincide with the eclipse . Logistical problems were expected with the influx of visitors , especially for smaller communities . The sale of counterfeit eclipse glasses was also anticipated to be a hazard for eye injuries .   Future total solar eclipses will cross the United States in April 2024 ( 12 states ) and August 2045 ( 10 states ) , and annular solar eclipses -- wherein the Moon appears smaller than the Sun -- will occur in October 2023 ( 9 states ) and June 2048 ( 9 states ) .

The total eclipse had a magnitude of 1.0306 and was visible within a narrow corridor 70 miles ( 110 km ) wide , crossing fourteen of the contiguous United States : Oregon , Idaho , Montana , Wyoming , Nebraska , Kansas , Iowa , Missouri , Illinois , Kentucky , Tennessee , Georgia , North Carolina , and South Carolina . It was first seen from land in the U.S. shortly after 10 : 15 a.m. PDT ( 17 : 15 UTC ) at Oregon 's Pacific coast , and then it progressed eastward through Salem , Oregon ; Idaho Falls , Idaho ; Casper , Wyoming ; Lincoln , Nebraska ; Kansas City , Missouri ; St. Louis , Missouri ; Hopkinsville , Kentucky ; Nashville , Tennessee ; Columbia , South Carolina about 2 : 41 p.m. ; and finally Charleston , South Carolina . A partial eclipse was seen for a greater time period , beginning shortly after 9 : 00 a.m. PDT along the Pacific Coast of Oregon . Weather forecasts predicted clear skies in Western U.S. and some Eastern states , but clouds in the Midwest and East Coast .     Animation of the eclipse shadow .

This was the first total solar eclipse visible from the Southeastern United States since the solar eclipse of March 7 , 1970 . Two NASA WB - 57F flew above the clouds , prolonging the observation time spent in the umbra . A partial solar eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the Moon 's penumbra , including all of North America , particularly areas just south of the totality pass , where the eclipse lasted about 3 -- 5 hours , northern South America , Western Europe , and some of Africa and north - east Asia .   At one location in Wyoming , a small group of astronomers used telescopic lenses to photograph the sun as it was in partial eclipse , while the ISS was also seen to briefly transit the sun .   Other celestial bodies ( edit )     During totality stars and 4 planets were visible , including Regulus close to the Sun . Mars was 8 degrees to the right , and Venus 34 degrees right . Mercury was 10 degrees left , and Jupiter 51 degrees left .   Solar eclipse and star - system Regulus ( upper left ) viewed from Cullowhee , NC .     During the eclipse for a long span of its path of totality , several bright stars and four planets were visible . The star - system Regulus was visible slightly to the west of the Sun . Mars was 8 degrees to the right , and Venus 34 degrees right . Mercury was 10 degrees left , and Jupiter 51 degrees left .   Other eclipses over the United States ( edit )   This was the first total solar eclipse visible from the United States since that of July 11 , 1991 -- which was seen only from part of Hawaii -- and the first visible from the contiguous United States since 1979 . An eclipse of comparable length ( up to 3 minutes , 8 seconds , with the longest eclipse being 6 minutes and 54 seconds ) occurred over the contiguous United States on March 7 , 1970 along the southern portions of the Eastern Seaboard , from Florida to Virginia .   The path of totality of the solar eclipse of February 26 , 1979 crossed only the states of Washington , Oregon , Idaho , Montana , and North Dakota . Many enthusiasts traveled to the Pacific Northwest to view the eclipse , since it would be the last chance to view such an eclipse in the contiguous United States for almost four decades .   Some American scientists and interested amateurs who wanted to experience a total eclipse participated in a four - day Atlantic Ocean cruise to view the solar eclipse of July 10 , 1972 as it passed near Nova Scotia . ( This is referenced in the Carly Simon hit song `` You 're So Vain '' in the lyric , `` Then you flew your Lear Jet up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the Sun . '' ) Organizers of the cruise advertised in astronomical journals and in planetarium announcements , emphasizing the rarity of the event .  The path of totality across the United States  The August 2017 eclipse was the first with a path of totality crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the U.S. since 1918 . Also , its path of totality made landfall exclusively within the United States , making it the first such eclipse since the country 's declaration of independence in 1776 . Prior to this , the path of totality of the eclipse of June 13 , 1257 , was the last to make landfall exclusively on lands currently part of the United States .   The path of the 2017 eclipse crosses with the path of the upcoming total solar eclipse of April 8 , 2024 , with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois in Makanda Township at Cedar Lake , just south of Carbondale . An area of about 9,000 square miles , including the cities of Makanda , Carbondale , Cape Girardeau , Missouri , and Paducah , Kentucky , will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of less than seven years . The cities of Benton , Carbondale , Chester , Harrisburg , Marion , and Metropolis in Illinois ; Cape Girardeau , Farmington , and Perryville in Missouri , as well as Paducah , Kentucky , will also be in the path of the 2024 eclipse , thereby earning the distinction of witnessing two total solar eclipses in seven years .   The solar eclipse of August 12 , 2045 will have a very similar path of totality over the U.S. to the 2017 eclipse : about 400 km ( 250 mi ) to the southwest , also crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the country ; however , totality will be more than twice as long .

Only those in Iceland , Ireland , Northern Ireland , Scotland and the Portuguese Azores archipelago saw the eclipse from beginning to end ; in the rest of the UK , Norway , the Netherlands , Belgium , France , Spain , and Portugal , sunset occurred before the end of the eclipse . In Germany , the beginning of the eclipse was visible just at sunset only in the extreme northwest of the country . In all regions east of the orange line on the map , the eclipse was not visible .   West Africa ( edit )   In some locations in West Africa and western North Africa , a partial eclipse was seen just before and during sunset .   Media and scientific coverage ( edit )  The Moon 's umbra , as seen from the International Space Station  A large number of media outlets broadcast coverage of the eclipse , including television and internet outlets . NASA announced plans to offer streaming coverage through its NASA TV and NASA Edge outlets , using cameras stationed on the ground along the path of totality , along with cameras on high - altitude balloons , jets , and coverage from the International Space Station ; NASA stated that `` never before will a celestial event be viewed by so many and explored from so many vantage points -- from space , from the air , and from the ground . '' ABC , CBS , and NBC announced that they would respectively broadcast live television specials to cover the eclipse with correspondents stationed across the path of totality , along with CNN , Fox News Channel , Science , and The Weather Channel . The PBS series Nova presented streaming coverage on Facebook hosted by Miles O'Brien , and aired a special episode chronicling the event -- `` Eclipse Over America '' -- later in the day ( which marked the fastest production turnaround time in Nova history ) .   Other institutions and services also announced plans to stream their perspectives of the eclipse , including the Exploratorium in San Francisco , the Elephant Sanctuary of Hohenwald , Tennessee , the Slooh robotic telescope app , and The Virtual Telescope Project . The Eclipse Ballooning Project , a consortium of schools and colleges that sent 50 high - altitude balloons into the sky during the eclipse to conduct experiments , provided streams of footage and GPS tracking of its launches . Contact with one balloon with $13,000 of scientific equipment , launched under the aegis of the LGF Museum of Natural History near Vale , Oregon , was lost at 20,000 feet ( 6,100 m ) . Given that the balloon was believed to have burst at 100,000 feet ( 30,000 m ) , it could have parachuted down anywhere from eastern Oregon to Caldwell , Idaho ( most likely ) to Sun Valley , Idaho ; a $1,000 reward is offered for its recovery .   The National Solar Observatory organized Citizen CATE volunteers to man 60 identical telescopes and instrumentation packages along the totality path to study changes in the corona over the duration of the eclipse .   In orbit , the satellites Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , the International Space Station , the Solar Dynamics Observatory , the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer , Solar and Heliospheric Observatory , and Hinode gathered data from the eclipse .   A viewing party was held at the White House , during which President Donald Trump appeared on the Truman Balcony with First Lady Melania Trump . With the sun partially eclipsed , President Trump looked briefly in the general direction of the sun before using solar viewing glasses .   The rapper Joey Badass boasted of watching the solar eclipse without viewing glasses , considering that `` our ancestors ai n't have no fancy eyewear ( and ) they ai n't all go blind '' . Unlike the US president , he did not wear viewing glasses during the entire eclipse . Later , he complained of vision problems and had to cancel his Cleveland , Chicago & Toronto shows on the Everybody Tour , due to `` unforeseen circumstances '' .   The eclipse generated reports of abnormal behavior in animal and plant life . Some farm animals including domestic chickens came out from under their coops and began grooming , usually an evening activity . Horses also displayed increased whinnying , running , and jumping after the event . Cicadas were reported to grow louder before going silent during totality . Various birds were also observed flying in unusually large formations . Flowers such as the Hibiscus closed their petals which typically happens at night , before opening again after the solar event .   NASA reported over 90 million page views of the eclipse on its websites , making it the agency 's biggest online event ever , beating the previous web traffic record about seven times over .   Counterfeit eclipse glasses ( edit )  See also : Solar viewer  In the months leading up to the eclipse , many counterfeit glasses were put up for sale . Effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light , but most UV and infrared light as well . For visible light , the user should only be able to see the Sun , sunglint reflected off shiny metal , halogen bulbs , the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs , and similarly intense sources . Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and infrared light requires the use of spectrophotometer , which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment .   The eye 's retina lacks pain receptors , and thus damage can occur without one 's awareness .   The American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) said products meeting the ISO 12312 - 2 standard avoid risk to one 's eyes , and issued a list of reputable vendors of eclipse glasses . The organization warned against products claiming ISO certification or even citing the same number , but not tested by an accredited laboratory . Another problem was counterfeits of reputable vendors ' products , some even claiming the company 's name such as with American Paper Optics which published information detailing the differences between its glasses and counterfeits .   Andrew Lund , the owner of a company which produces eclipse glasses , noted that not all counterfeit glasses were necessarily unsafe . He stated to Quartz that the counterfeits he tested blocked the majority of harmful light spectrum , concluding that `` the IP is getting ripped off , but the good news is there are no long - term harmful effects . '' As one example , the Springdale Library in metropolitan Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , accidentally passed out dozens of pairs of counterfeit eclipse glasses , but as of August 23 had not received any reports of eye damage .   On July 27 , 2017 , Amazon required all eclipse viewing products sold on its website have a submission of origin and safety information , and proof of an accredited ISO certification . In mid-August 2017 , Amazon recalled and pulled listings for eclipse viewing glasses that `` may not comply with industry standards '' , and gave refunds to customers who had purchased them .   Eye damage ( edit )   Short - term damage includes solar keratitis , which is similar to sunburn of the cornea . Symptoms usually occur within twenty - four hours and include eye pain and light sensitivity .   Long - term or permanent damage includes solar retinopathy , which occurs when the sun burns a hole in the retina , usually at the fovea ( the focus of the retina ) . Symptoms can occur as long as several weeks after the incident , and can include loss of central vision and / or other vision , as well as eye pain and light sensitivity , afterimages , and changes in color vision .   Depending on the severity of damage , vision problems can last for several months or be permanent .   Dr. Avnish Deobhakta , an ophthalmologist in New York , states that , `` `` If you 're looking at the sun you 're actually focusing , intentionally , the light of the sun onto the spot ( fovea ) where you want the most precise vision . ''   Following a total eclipse in the United Kingdom in 1999 , at least 14 cases of permanent damage were confirmed .   One story of solar eclipse danger was illustrated by the case of Mr. Tomososki , who damaged his eyesight when viewing a 1962 eclipse , leaving him with a pea - sized blind spot for the rest of his life . During the 2017 eclipse he warned the country to not make the mistake he did . While some can recover , the danger of an eclipse comes in part because the excitement can override the instinct to not look at the sun .   Planning ( edit )  A message board on U.S. Route 64 in North Carolina alerting drivers of the eclipse  Officials inside and near the path of totality planned -- sometimes for years -- for the sudden influx of people . Smaller towns struggled to arrange viewing sites and logistics for what could have been a tourism boom or a disaster .   In the American West , illegal camping was a major concern , including near cities like Jackson Hole , Wyoming . Idaho 's Office of Emergency Management said Idaho was a prime viewing state , and advised jurisdictions to prepare for service load increases ; nearly every hotel and motel room , campground , and in some cases backyards for nearly 100 miles ( 160 km ) north and south of the path of totality had been reserved several months , if not years , in advance . The state anticipated up to 500,000 visitors to join its 1.6 million residents .   Oregon deployed six National Guard aircraft and 150 soldiers because the influx of visitors coincided with the state 's fire season . Hospital staffing , and supplies of blood and anti -- snake bite antidote , were augmented along the totality line .   In Oregon , there were reports of hoteliers canceling existing reservations made at the regular market rate and increasing their rate , sometimes threefold or more , for guests staying to view the eclipse . The Oregon Department of Justice ( DOJ ) investigated various complaints and reached settlements with affected customers of at least 10 hotels in the state . These settlements included refunds to the customers and fines paid to the DOJ .   Post-eclipse traffic problems ( edit )   Although traffic to areas within the path of totality was somewhat spread out over the days prior to the eclipse , there were widespread traffic problems across the United States after the event ended . Michael Zeiler , an eclipse cartographer , had estimated that between 1.85 million and 7.4 million people would travel to the path of the eclipse .   In Oregon , an estimated one million people were expected to arrive that the Oregon National Guard was called in to help manage traffic in Madras along US 26 and US 97 . Madras Municipal Airport received more than 400 mostly personal planes that queued for hours while waiting to leave after the eclipse .   Officials in Idaho , where the totality path crossed the center of the state , began planning for the eclipse a year in advance . The state Transportation Department suspended construction projects along Interstate 15 , which traverses Eastern Idaho , from August 18 -- 22 in order to have all lanes open ; their counterparts in neighboring Utah , where many were expected to travel the 220 miles ( 350 km ) north via the highway from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area , did the same . On the morning of the eclipse , many drivers left before dawn , creating traffic volume along I - 15 normally not seen until morning rush hour ; northbound traffic on the interstate in Box Elder County north of Salt Lake City slowed to 10 -- 15 miles per hour ( 16 -- 24 km / h ) . The Idaho State Police ( ISP ) stationed a patrol car along I - 15 every 15 miles ( 24 km ) between Shelley and the Utah border .  Traffic backed up on I - 15 / US 26 south of Idaho Falls  After the eclipse , traffic more than doubled along I - 15 southbound , with extensive traffic jams continuing for eight hours as viewers who had traveled north into the totality path from Utah returned there and to points south . The ISP tweeted a picture of bumper - to - bumper traffic stalled on the interstate just south of Idaho Falls . Motorists reported to local news outlets that it was taking them two hours to travel the 47 miles ( 76 km ) from that city to Pocatello to the south , a journey that normally takes 45 minutes . Others reported that it took three hours to travel from Idaho Falls to the closer city of Blackfoot , 30 miles ( 48 km ) farther north of Pocatello .   In the rest of the state the impact was less severe . Traffic nearly doubled on US 93 , and was up 55 percent on US 20 .   For some northbound travelers on I - 15 , the Montana Department of Transportation had failed to make similar plans to those in Idaho , scheduling a road construction project to begin on August 21 that narrowed a section of the highway to a single northbound lane , near the exit to Clark Canyon Dam south of Dillon . Though that stretch of highway generally has a traffic count of less than 1,000 vehicles per day , on the day of the eclipse there were over a thousand vehicles per hour at peak times . As a result , traffic backed up as far as Lima , creating a delay of at least an hour for travelers heading northward . Further , as construction had not yet begun , drivers observed cones set up but no workers present on the road . While the state traditionally halts construction projects during high traffic periods , a state official admitted `` we ... probably made a bad mistake here in this regard . ''  Traffic waiting to get on Interstate 25 at Glendo , Wyoming , after the eclipse  In Wyoming , estimates were that the population of the state , officially 585,000 , may have doubled or even tripled , with traffic counts on August 21 showing 536,000 more cars than the five - year average for the third Monday in August ; a 68 percent increase . One official offered an estimate of `` two people in every car '' to arrive at a one - million - visitor figure , and others noted that one million was a conservative estimate based on a one - day traffic count of limited portions of major highways . There were additional arrivals by aircraft , plus travelers who arrived early or stayed for additional days . Two days before the eclipse , traffic increased 18 percent over a five - year average , with an additional 131,000 vehicles on the road . Sunday saw an additional 217,000 - vehicle increase .   Following the eclipse , more than 500,000 vehicles traveled Wyoming roads , creating large traffic jams , particularly on southbound and eastbound highways . Drivers reported that it took up to 10 hours to travel 160 miles ( 260 km ) into northern Colorado . There was one traffic fatality , and another fatality related to an off - highway ATV accident , but in general there were far fewer incidents and traffic citations than authorities had anticipated .   In Tennessee , the Knoxville News Sentinel described the traffic problems created by the eclipse as the worst ever seen in that part of the state . One backup along Interstate 75 reached 34 miles ( 55 km ) in length , between Niota and the Interstate 40 interchange at Farragut . A spokesman for the state 's Department of Transportation allowed that the traffic jams were the worst he had seen in six and a half years on the job , noting that accidents had aggravated the already heavy traffic flows , attributed the I - 75 congestion to Knoxville - area residents heading for the totality path at Sweetwater and returning during what was the city 's normal afternoon rush hour .   Before the eclipse , state officials had described their traffic expectations as equivalent to that generated by the Bonnaroo Music Festival , the twice - a-season NASCAR Monster Energy Cup races at Bristol or the formerly - held Boomsday fireworks festival . `` Maybe they should have considered a tsunami of traffic combining all three of those heavily attended events '' , the News Sentinel commented . The Tennessee Highway Patrol made sure that `` ( e ) very trooper not on sick leave or military leave or pre-approved leave ( wa ) s working '' the day of the eclipse ; the state DOT made sure its full complement of emergency - aid HELP trucks were available as well . Alert signs on the highways also warned motorists not to pull over onto the shoulders to watch the eclipse as it could increase the risk of dangerous accidents and block the path of emergency vehicles .   In North Carolina , the Department of Transportation added cameras , message boards and safety patrols in the counties where the total eclipse would take place , as well as stopping road work . The department warned that due to `` unprecedented '' traffic ordinary activities requiring driving might prove difficult , and advised people to act as if there were snow .   In Kentucky , particularly around the Hopkinsville area , which was dubbed `` Eclipseville , USA '' , post-eclipse traffic caused extensive delays . The en masse departure of tourists via Interstate 69 as well as the Western Kentucky Parkway resulted in commute times double or even triple of normal . The Hopkinsville - to - Lexington commute under normal circumstances lasts three and a half hours .   Impact on solar power ( edit )   An eclipse causes a reduction of solar power generation where the Moon shadow covers any solar panel , as do clouds .   The North American Electric Reliability Corporation predicted minor impacts , and attempted to measure the impact of the 2017 eclipse . In California , solar power was projected to decrease by 4 -- 6,000 megawatts at 70 MW / minute , and then ramp up by 90 MW / minute as the shadow passes . CAISO 's typical ramp rate is 29 megawatts per minute . Around 4 GW mainly in North Carolina and Georgia were expected to be 90 percent obscured .   After the 2017 eclipse , grid operators in California reported having lost 3,000 -- 3,500 megawatts of utility - scale solar power , which was made up for by hydropower and gas reliably and as expected , mimicking the usual duck curve . Energy demand management was also used to mitigate the solar drop .   NV Energy prepared for the solar eclipse months in advance and collaborated with 17 western states . When the eclipse began covering California with partial darkness , which reduced its usual amount of solar - generated electricity , NV Energy sent power there . Likewise , when Nevada received less sunlight , other west coast states supplied electricity to it . During the solar eclipse , the state of Nevada lost about 450 megawatts of electricity , the amount used by about a quarter million typical residences .   The 2015 eclipse caused manageable solar power decreases in Europe ; in Germany , solar power dropped from 14 GW to 7 GW , of a 38 GW solar power capacity .   Commemorative stamp ( edit )  Main article : 2017 Total Solar Eclipse stamp  On June 20 , 2017 , the United States Postal Service released the first application of thermochromic ink to postage stamps in its Total Eclipse of the Sun Forever stamp to commemorate the solar eclipse of August 21 , 2017 . When pressed with a finger , body heat turns the black circle in the center of the stamp into an image of the full moon . The stamp image is a photo of the solar eclipse of March 29 , 2006 seen in Jalu , Libya . The photo was taken by retired NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak .

Saros series 145 ( edit )   This solar eclipse is a part of Saros cycle 145 , repeating every 18 years , 11 days , 8 hours , containing 77 events . The series started with a partial solar eclipse on January 4 , 1639 , and reached a first annular eclipse on June 6 , 1891 . It was a hybrid event on June 17 , 1909 , and total eclipses from June 29 , 1927 , through September 9 , 2648 . The series ends at member 77 as a partial eclipse on April 17 , 3009 .

It is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai , one of the seven emirates that make up the country . Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country 's Federal Supreme Council . The city of Dubai is located on the emirate 's northern coastline and heads the Dubai - Sharjah - Ajman metropolitan area . Dubai will host World Expo 2020 .   Dubai emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East . It is also a major transport hub for passengers and cargo . By the 1960s , Dubai 's economy was based on revenues from trade and , to a smaller extent , oil exploration concessions , but oil was not discovered until 1966 . Oil revenue first started to flow in 1969 . Dubai 's oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city , but its reserves are limited and production levels are low : today , less than 5 % of the emirate 's revenue comes from oil .   The Emirate 's Western - style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism , aviation , real estate , and financial services . Dubai was recently named the best destination for Muslim travellers by Salam Standard . Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events . The city has become iconic for its skyscrapers and high - rise buildings , in particular the world 's tallest building , the Burj Khalifa . Dubai has been criticised for human rights violations concerning the city 's largely South Asian and Filipino workforce . Dubai 's property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008 -- 09 following the financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 , but the emirate 's economy has made a return to growth , with a projected 2015 budget surplus .   As of 2012 , Dubai was the 22nd most expensive city in the world and the most expensive city in the Middle East . In 2014 , Dubai 's hotel rooms were rated as the second most expensive in the world , after Geneva . In 2013 , U.S. global consulting firm Mercer rated Dubai the best place to live in the Middle East .

One theory suggests the word was used to describe the souq , which was similar to the souq in Ba . An Arabic proverb says `` Daba Dubai '' ( Arabic : دبا دبي \\u200e ) , meaning `` They came with a lot of money . '' According to Fedel Handhal , a scholar on the UAE 's history and culture , the word Dubai may have come from the word daba ( Arabic : دبا \\u200e ) ( a past tense derivative of yadub ( Arabic : يدب \\u200e ) , which means `` to creep '' ) , referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland . The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word , but to its alternative meaning of `` baby locust '' ( Arabic : جراد \\u200e ) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement . An inhabitant or native of the city is a Dubaian .   History ( edit )  Main articles : History of Dubai and Timeline of Dubai Typical scene in old Dubai , Old District of Al Bastakiya  Although stone tools have been found at many archaeological sites , little is known about the UAE 's early inhabitants as only a few settlements have been found . Many ancient towns in the area were trading centres between the Eastern and Western worlds . The remnants of an ancient mangrove swamp , dated at 7000 BC , were discovered during the construction of sewer lines near Dubai Internet City . The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland , becoming part of the city 's present coastline . Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries . Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area , the people in this region worshiped Bajir ( or Bajar ) . After the spread of Islam in the region , the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south - east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians . Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of Al - Jumayra ( Jumeirah ) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period .   The earliest recorded mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian - Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al - Bakri . The Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai ( Dibei ) for its pearling industry .   Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was , by 1822 , a town of some 7 -- 800 members of the Baniyas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnoon of Abu Dhabi .   In 1833 , following tribal feuding , members of the Al Bu Falasa tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai . The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Ubaid bin Saeed and Maktum bin Butti who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836 , leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty .   Dubai signed the first treaty of Perpetual Maritime Truce in 1820 along with other Trucial States , which was followed by a further treaty in 1853 . It also -- like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast -- entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate 's security in 1892 .   Two catastrophes struck the town during the 1800s . First , in 1841 , a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality , forcing residents to relocate east to Deira . Then , in 1894 , fire swept through Deira , burning down most homes . However , the town 's geographical location continued to attract traders and merchants from around the region . The emir of Dubai was keen to attract foreign traders and lowered trade tax brackets , which lured traders away from Sharjah and Bandar Lengeh , the region 's main trade hubs at the time . Persian merchants naturally looked across to the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf finally making their homes in Dubai . They continued to trade with Lingah , however , as do many of the dhows in Dubai Creek today , and they named their district Bastakiya , after the Bastak region in southern Persia .   Pre-oil Dubai ( edit )  Typical Bastakiya street in Deira  Dubai 's geographical proximity to Iran made it an important trade location . The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen , chiefly those from Iran , many of whom eventually settled in the town . By the beginning of the 20th century , it was an important port .   Dubai was known for its pearl exports until the 1930s ; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the Great Depression in the 1930s and the innovation of cultured pearls . With the collapse of the pearling industry , Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents starved or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf .   In the early days since its inception , Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi . In 1947 , a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border escalated into war . Arbitration by the British and the creation of a buffer frontier running south eastwards from the coast at Ras Hasian resulted in a temporary cessation of hostilities .   Despite a lack of oil , Dubai 's ruler from 1958 , Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum , used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure . Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure , including electricity , telephone services and both the ports and airport operators . An airport of sorts ( a runway built on salt flats ) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and , in 1959 , the emirate 's first hotel , the Airlines Hotel , was constructed . This was followed by the Ambassador and Carlton Hotels in 1968 .  The Al Ras district in Deira , Dubai in the 1960s  On 7 April 1961 , the Dubai - based MV Dara , a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between Basra ( Iraq ) , Kuwait and Bombay ( India ) , was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai . Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al - Quwain , an explosion tore out the second class cabins and started fires . The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred . A flotilla of small boats from Dubai , Sharjah , Ajman and Umm al - Quwain picked up survivors but in all 238 lives were lost in the disaster .   In 1962 the British Political Agent noted that `` Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built ... the Ruler is determined , against advice ( from the British ) to press on with the construction of a jet airport ... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright . ''   In 1962 , with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent , Sheikh Rashid approached his brother in law , the Ruler of Qatar , for a loan to build the first bridge crossing Dubai 's creek . This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the Deira side .   BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai , fearing a lack of demand for seats . However , by the time the asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965 , opening Dubai to both regional and long haul traffic , a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights . In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai 's first duty - free shops .   Oil era ( edit )  View of Downtown Dubai from Burj Khalifa  After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi , oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966 , albeit in far smaller quantities . The first field was named ' Fateh ' or ' good fortune ' . This led the emirate to grant concessions to international oil companies , thus leading to a massive influx of foreign workers , mainly Asians and Middle easterners . Between 1968 and 1975 the city 's population grew by over 300 % .   As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field , located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai , a number of 50,000 gallon storage tanks were built , known locally as ' Kazzans ' , by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field . These were constructed by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company , which gave the beach its local name ( Chicago Beach ) until the Chicago Beach Hotel was demolished and replaced by the Jumeirah Beach Hotel in the late 1990s .   Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion . Oil revenue , flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate 's limited reserves were depleted . Oil accounted for 24 % of GDP in 1990 , but had reduced to 7 % of GDP by 2004 .   Critically , one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of Port Rashid , a deep water free port constructed by British company Halcrow . Originally intended to be a four - berth port , it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing . The project was an outstanding success , with shipping queuing to access the new facilities . The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972 , although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built . Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed .   Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure , including roads , bridges , schools and hospitals .   Reaching the UAE 's Act of union ( edit )  Adi Bitar in a meeting with Sheiks Rashid Al Maktoum , Mohammad Al Maktoum , and Maktoum Al Maktoum in Dubai , 1968  Dubai and the other ' trucial states ' had long been a British protectorate where the British took care of foreign policy and defence , as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf . This was to change with PM Harold Wilson 's announcement , on 16 January 1968 , that all British troops were to be withdrawn from ' East of Aden ' . The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates , together with Qatar and Bahrain , into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind .   The principle of union was first agreed between the ruler of Abu Dhabi , Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan , and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah , near Al Semeih , a desert stop between the two emirates . The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates , including Qatar and Bahrain , into the union . Over the next two years , negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed - often stormy - as a form of union was thrashed out . The nine - state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where heavy - handed British intervention resulted in a walk - out by Qatar and Ras Al Khaimah . Bahrain and Qatar were to drop out of talks , leaving six emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971 .   On 2 December 1971 , Dubai , together with Abu Dhabi , Sharjah , Ajman , Umm al - Quwain and Fujairah joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates . The seventh emirate , Ras Al Khaimah , joined the UAE on 10 February 1972 , following Iran 's annexation of the RAK - claimed Tunbs islands .   In 1973 , Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency : the UAE dirham . In that same year , the prior monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates .   Modern Dubai ( edit )  Dubai Palm Jumeirah and Marina in 2011  During the 1970s , Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade , even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war . Border disputes between the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE ; it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached that ended disagreements . The Jebel Ali port was established in 1979 . JAFZA ( Jebel Ali Free Zone ) was built around the port in 1985 to provide foreign companies unrestricted import of labour and export capital . Dubai airport and the aviation industry also continued to grow .   The Gulf War of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city , as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade , but subsequently , the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived . Later in the 1990s , many foreign trading communities -- first from Kuwait , during the Gulf War , and later from Bahrain , during the Shia unrest -- moved their businesses to Dubai . Dubai provided refuelling bases to allied forces at the Jebel Ali Free Zone during the Gulf War , and again during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq . Large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism .

In the false - color satellite images making up the video , bare desert is tan , plant - covered land is red , water is black and urban areas are silver . Sand dunes on the city outskirts Abras across the Dubai Creek  Dubai is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level ( 16 m or 52 ft above ) . The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south , Sharjah in the northeast , and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast . Hatta , a minor exclave of the emirate , is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman ( in the west ) and Ras Al Khaimah ( in the north ) . The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate . Dubai is positioned at 25 ° 16 ′ 11 '' N 55 ° 18 ′ 34 '' E \\ufeff / \\ufeff 25.2697 ° N 55.3095 ° E \\ufeff / 25.2697 ; 55.3095 and covers an area of 1,588 sq mi ( 4,110 km ) , which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial 1,500 sq mi ( 3,900 km ) designation due to land reclamation from the sea .   Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert . However , the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai 's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns , while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country . The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine , clean and white . East of the city , the salt - crusted coastal plains , known as sabkha , give way to a north - south running line of dunes . Farther east , the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide .   The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains , which run alongside Dubai 's border with Oman at Hatta . The Western Hajar chain has an arid , jagged and shattered landscape , whose mountains rise to about 1,300 metres ( 4,265 feet ) in some places . Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases ; however , Dubai does have a natural inlet , Dubai Creek , which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through . Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes , which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains . A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter . Seismically , Dubai is in a very stable zone -- the nearest seismic fault line , the Zagros Fault , is 200 kilometres ( 124 miles ) from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai . Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami .   The sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms . Desert hyacinths grow in the sabkha plains east of the city , while acacia and ghaf trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains . Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and neem as well as imported trees such as the eucalypts grow in Dubai 's natural parks . The houbara bustard , striped hyena , caracal , desert fox , falcon and Arabian oryx are common in Dubai 's desert . Dubai is on the migration path between Europe , Asia and Africa , and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn . The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish , including the hammour . The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish , jellyfish , coral , dugong , dolphins , whales and sharks . Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the hawksbill turtle and green turtle , which are listed as endangered species .   Dubai Creek runs northeast - southwest through the city . The eastern section of the city forms the locality of Deira and is flanked by the emirate of Sharjah in the east and the town of Al Aweer in the south . The Dubai International Airport is located south of Deira , while the Palm Deira is located north of Deira in the Persian Gulf . Much of Dubai 's real - estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek , on the Jumeirah coastal belt . Port Rashid , Jebel Ali , Burj Al Arab , the Palm Jumeirah and theme - based free - zone clusters such as Business Bay are all located in this section . Dubai is notable for sculpted artificial island complexes including the Palm Islands and The World archipelago .   Climate ( edit )  Main article : Climate of Dubai  Dubai has a hot desert climate . Summers in Dubai are extremely hot , windy , and humid , with an average high around 41 ° C ( 106 ° F ) and overnight lows around 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) in the hottest month , August . Most days are sunny throughout the year . Winters are warm with an average high of 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) and overnight lows of 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) in January , the coldest month . Precipitation , however , has been increasing in the last few decades , with accumulated rain reaching 94.3 mm ( 3.71 in ) per year . Dubai summers are also known for the very high humidity level , which can make it very uncomfortable for many with exceptionally high dewpoints in summer . The highest recorded temperature in the UAE is 52.1 ° C ( 126 ° F ) , reached in July 2002 .

The ruler , His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , is also the Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and member of the Supreme Council of the Union ( SCU ) . Dubai appoints 8 members in two - term periods to the Federal National Council ( FNC ) of the UAE , the supreme federal legislative body .   The Dubai Municipality ( DM ) was established by the then - ruler of Dubai , Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum , in 1954 for purposes of city planning , citizen services and upkeep of local facilities . DM is chaired by Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum , deputy ruler of Dubai , and comprises several departments such as the Roads Department , Planning and Survey Department , Environment and Public Health Department and Financial Affairs Department . In 2001 , Dubai Municipality embarked on an e-Government project with the intention of providing 40 of its city services through its web portal , ( dubai.ae ) . Thirteen such services were launched by October 2001 , while several other services were expected to be operational in the future . Dubai Municipality is also in charge of the city 's sanitation and sewage infrastructure .   The UAE has a Minister of Happiness , appointed by Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum . The UAE has also appointed a Minister of Tolerance to promote tolerance as a fundamental value of the UAE , a country filled with a diverse range of faiths and ethnicities , and also a Minister for Youth Affairs .   Law enforcement ( edit )   The Dubai Police Force , founded in 1956 in the locality of Naif , has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate . The force is under direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum .  Dubai Police operates a fleet of exotic cars .  Dubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only emirates that do not conform to the federal judicial system of the United Arab Emirates . The emirate 's judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance , the Court of Appeal , and the Court of Cassation . The Court of First Instance consists of the Civil Court , which hears all civil claims ; the Criminal Court , which hears claims originating from police complaints ; and Sharia Court , which is responsible for matters between Muslims . Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court . The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only .   Sharia laws ( edit )   Kissing in certain places is illegal and can result in deportation . Sometimes , certain narrow exemptions to Islamic law are made for adult non-Muslims . Adult non-Muslims are allowed to consume alcohol in licensed venues , typically within hotels , or at home with the possession of an alcohol license . Restaurants outside hotels in Dubai are typically not permitted to sell alcohol . Like other parts of the world , drinking and driving is illegal .   Human rights ( edit )  Main article : Human rights in Dubai  Human rights organisations have heavily criticised violations of human rights in Dubai . In a notorious case , a Norwegian businesswoman who claimed to have been raped was arrested and sentenced to sixteen months in prison for having extra-marital sex .   Some of the 250,000 foreign labourers in the city have been alleged to live in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as `` less than humane '' . The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the difficult - to - make documentary , Slaves in Dubai ( 2009 ) . The Dubai government has denied labour injustices and stated that the watchdog 's ( Human Rights Watch ) accusations were ' misguided ' . The filmmaker explained in interviews how it was necessary to go undercover to avoid discovery by the authorities , who impose high fines on reporters attempting to document human rights abuses , including the conditions of construction workers . Towards the end of March 2006 , the government had announced steps to allow construction unions . UAE labour minister Ali al - Kaabi said : `` Labourers will be allowed to form unions .

As of June 2017 , the population is 2,789,000 . The region covers 1,287.5 square kilometres ( 497.1 sq mi ) . The population density is 408.18 / km -- more than eight times that of the entire country . Dubai is the second most expensive city in the region and 20th most expensive city in the world .   As of 2013 , only about 15 % of the population of the emirate was made up of UAE nationals , with the rest comprising expatriates , many of whom either have been in the country for generations or were born in the UAE . Approximately 85 % of the expatriate population ( and 71 % of the emirate 's total population ) was Asian , chiefly Indian ( 51 % ) and Pakistani ( 16 % ) ; other significant Asian groups include Bangladeshis ( 9 % ) and Filipinos ( 3 % ) . There is a sizable community of Somalis numbering around 30,000 , as well as other communities of various nationalities . A quarter of the population ( local and foreign ) reportedly traces their origins to Iran . In addition , 16 % of the population ( or 288,000 persons ) living in collective labour accommodation were not identified by ethnicity or nationality , but were thought to be primarily Asian . There are over 100,000 British expatriates in Dubai , by far the largest group of Western expatriates in the city . The median age in the emirate was about 27 years . In 2014 , there were estimated to be 15.54 births and 1.99 deaths per 1,000 people . There are other Arab nationals , including GCC nationals .   Arabic is the national and official language of the United Arab Emirates . The Gulf dialect of Arabic is spoken natively by the Emirati people . English is used as a second language . Other major languages spoken in Dubai due to immigration are Malayalam , Hindi - Urdu ( or Hindustani ) , Gujarati , Persian , Sindhi , Tamil , Punjabi , Pashto , Bengali , Balochi , Tulu , Kannada , Sinhala , Marathi , Telugu , Tagalog and Chinese , in addition to many other languages .   Religion ( edit )  See also : Islam in the United Arab Emirates and Religion in the United Arab Emirates Jumeirah Mosque  Article 7 of the UAE 's Provisional Constitution declares Islam the official state religion of the UAE . The government subsidises almost 95 % of mosques and employs all Imams ; approximately 5 % of mosques are entirely private , and several large mosques have large private endowments . All mosques in Dubai are managed by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department also known as `` Awqaf '' under the Government of Dubai and all Imams are appointed by the Government . Any person held preaching racism , religious hatred or promoting religious extremism is usually jailed and deported .  Minorities ( edit ) Evangelical church in Dubai  Dubai also has large Christian , Hindu , Sikh , Bahá'í , Buddhist and other religious communities residing in the city .   Non-Muslim groups can own their own houses of worship , where they can practice their religion freely , by requesting a land grant and permission to build a compound . Groups that do not have their own buildings must use the facilities of other religious organisations or worship in private homes . Non-Muslim religious groups are permitted to advertise group functions openly and distribute various religious literature . However , outright proselytising is strictly prohibited under penalty of criminal prosecution , imprisonment and deportation for engaging in behaviour offensive to Islam . Catholics are served pastorally by the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia . British preacher Reverend Andrew Thompson claimed that the United Arab Emirates is one of the most tolerant places in the world towards Christians , and that it is easier to be a Christian in the UAE , than in the UK .   Economy ( edit )  Main article : Economy of Dubai Jebel Ali Port  One of the world 's fastest growing economies , Dubai 's gross domestic product is projected at US $107.1 billion , with a growth rate of 6.1 % in 2014 . Although a number of core elements of Dubai 's trading infrastructure were built on the back of the oil industry , revenues from oil and natural gas account for less than 5 % of the emirate 's revenues . It is estimated that Dubai produces 50,000 to 70,000 barrels ( 7,900 to 11,100 m ) of oil a day and substantial quantities of gas from offshore fields . The emirate 's share in the UAE 's total gas revenues is about 2 % . Dubai 's oil reserves have diminished significantly and are expected to be exhausted in 20 years . Real estate and construction ( 22.6 % ) , trade ( 16 % ) , entrepôt ( 15 % ) and financial services ( 11 % ) are the largest contributors to Dubai 's economy .   Dubai 's non-oil foreign trade stood at $362 billion in 2014 . Of the overall trade volumes , imports had the biggest share with a value of $230 billion while exports and re-exports to the emirate stood at $31 billion and $101 billion respectively .   By 2014 , China had emerged as Dubai 's largest international trading partner , with a total of $47.7 billion in trade flows , up 29 % from 2013 . India was second among Dubai 's key trading partners with a trade of $29.7 billion , followed by the United States at $22.62 billion . The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was Dubai 's fourth trading partner globally and first in the GCC and Arab world with a total trade value of $14.2 billion . Trade with Germany in 2014 totalled $12.3 , Switzerland and Japan both at $11.72 billion and UK trade totalled $10.9 billion .  Dubai Creek , which separates Deira from Bur Dubai , played a vital role in the economic development of the city  Historically , Dubai and its twin across Dubai Creek , Deira ( independent of Dubai City at that time ) , were important ports of call for Western manufacturers . Most of the new city 's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area . Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s . Dubai has a free trade in gold and , until the 1990s , was the hub of a `` brisk smuggling trade '' of gold ingots to India , where gold import was restricted . Dubai 's Jebel Ali port , constructed in the 1970s , has the largest man - made harbour in the world and was ranked seventh globally for the volume of container traffic it supports . Dubai is also a hub for service industries such as information technology and finance , with industry - specific free zones throughout the city . Dubai Internet City , combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM ( Dubai Technology , Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority ) , is one such enclave , whose members include IT firms such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise , HP Inc. , Google , EMC Corporation , Oracle Corporation , Microsoft , Dell and IBM , and media organisations such as MBC , CNN , BBC , Reuters , Sky News and AP .   The government 's decision to diversify from a trade - based , oil - reliant economy to one that is service - and tourism - oriented made property more valuable , resulting in the property appreciation from 2004 to 2006 . A longer - term assessment of Dubai 's property market , however , showed depreciation ; some properties lost as much as 64 % of their value from 2001 to November 2008 . The large - scale real estate development projects have led to the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest projects in the world such as the Emirates Towers , the Burj Khalifa , the Palm Islands and the most expensive hotel , the Burj Al Arab . Dubai 's property market experienced a major downturn in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the slowing economic climate . By early 2009 , the situation had worsened with the Great Recession taking a heavy toll on property values , construction and employment . This has had a major impact on property investors in the region , some of whom were unable to release funds from investments made in property developments . As of February 2009 , Dubai 's foreign debt was estimated at approximately $80 billion , although this is a tiny fraction of the sovereign debt worldwide . Dubai real estate and UAE property experts believe that by avoiding the mistakes of the past , Dubai 's realty market can achieve stability in the future .  Downtown Dubai  The Dubai Financial Market ( DFM ) was established in March 2000 as a secondary market for trading securities and bonds , both local and foreign . As of fourth quarter 2006 , its trading volume stood at about 400 billion shares , worth $95 billion in total . The DFM had a market capitalisation of about $87 billion . The other Dubai - based stock exchange is NASDAQ Dubai , which is the international stock exchange in the Middle East . It enables a range of companies , including UAE and regional small and medium - sized enterprises , to trade on an exchange with an international brand name , with access by both regional and international investors .   DMCC ( Dubai Multi Commodities Centre ) was established in 2002 . It 's world 's fastest growing free zone and been nominated as `` Global Free Zone of the Year 2016 '' by The Financial Times fDi Magazine .   Dubai is also known as the City of Gold , because a major part of the economy is based on gold trades , with Dubai 's total gold trading volumes in H1 2011 reaching 580 tonnes , with an average price of US $1,455 per troy ounce .

( September 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     `` All That is Gold Does Not Glitter '' ( alternatively known as `` The Riddle of Strider '' or `` Song of Aragorn '' ) is a poem written by J.R.R. Tolkien for his fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings . It alludes to an integral part of the plot , and describes Aragorn , son of Arathorn .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Poem   2 Overview   3 Older version   4 References      Poem ( edit )    All that is gold does not glitter ,   Not all those who wander are lost ;   The old that is strong does not wither ,   Deep roots are not reached by the frost .     From the ashes , a fire shall be woken ,   A light from the shadows shall spring ;   Renewed shall be blade that was broken ,   The crownless again shall be king .    Overview ( edit )   The poem appears twice in The Fellowship of the Ring , the first volume of The Lord of the Rings . It appears first in Chapter Ten , `` Strider '' , in Gandalf 's letter to Frodo Baggins in Bree , although when Frodo reads it he does not realize that Strider ( Aragorn ) is the subject of the verse .   The verse is repeated by Bilbo at the Council of Elrond . He whispers to Frodo that he wrote it many years before , when Aragorn first revealed who he was .   In Peter Jackson 's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings for film , the poem appears in The Return of the King , when Arwen recites the last four lines of the poem as her father Elrond prepares to reforge the shards of Narsil for Aragorn . In the 1981 BBC radio dramatisation , the entire poem is heard in its original context , the letter left at Bree by Gandalf .   The way appearance displays reality in our world is largely inverted in Middle - earth with respect to the subject matter of the poem . The first line is a variant and rearrangement of the proverb `` All that glitters is not gold '' , known primarily from Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice , resulting in a proposition bearing a completely different meaning : Aragorn is vastly more important than he looks . The second line emphasizes the importance of the Rangers , suspiciously viewed as wanderers or vagabonds by those the Rangers actually protect from evil . Lines three and four emphasize the endurance of Aragorn 's royal lineage , while five and six emphasizes its renewal . They can also be seen to represent a spark of hope during a time of despair and danger . Line seven refers to the sword Narsil . Line eight foreshadows the crownless Aragorn 's accession to the throne of both the kingless Gondor and the vanished Arnor .   Older editions of The Lord of the Rings indexed the poem as `` The Riddle of Strider '' . From the 50th anniversary edition of 2005 on , the new , enlarged index by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull list it as `` All that is gold does not glitter '' .   Older version ( edit )   The early versions of the poem are recorded in The Treason of Isengard , part of The History of Middle - earth book series by Christopher Tolkien . The first draft of the poem , which at that stage of composition was the only content of Gandalf 's letter , reads :    All that is gold does not glitter ;   all that is long does not last ;   All that is old does not wither ;   not all that is over is past .    The second quatrain was added during the following revision :    Not all that have fallen are vanquished ;   a king may yet be without crown ,   A blade that was broken be brandished ;   and towers that were strong may fall down .    The lines were changed in stages , with many experimental forms rejected . Christopher Tolkien also suggested that `` the Sword that was Broken ( Narsil ) actually emerged from the verse ' All that is gold does not glitter ' : on this view , in ( the last version cited above ) the words a king may yet be without crown , A blade that was broken be brandished were no more than a further exemplification of the general moral .

Production ( edit )   Development ( edit )   Executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis announced that they were ending the half - season arc structure that was seen in seasons three through five , with Horowitz saying , `` We 're also planning a 22 - episode story as opposed to breaking it up into two halves this year . It has been really exciting and fun . '' Kitsis added : `` We are changing around what we 're doing this year and going back to that season 1 mentality of small town stories and smaller arcs . '' This season will focus on Storybrooke as the main setting , but will also show new realms and there will be the exploration of the Savior 's mythology . Kitsis and Horowitz hired two directors from their Freeform series Dead of Summer , Norman Buckley , Mairzee Almas , and Michael Schultz helm episodes of the season . Jennifer Lynch directed the eighth episode of the season , `` I 'll Be Your Mirror '' .   In January 2017 , ABC president Channing Dungey had been the first to suggest that the current narrative of the show would end with season six , regardless of whether or not there is a season seven . Shortly after this news , Jennifer Morrison revealed that the contracts for the original main cast members were expiring in April , expressing uncertainty about the future of the show and her participation in it beyond the current season . Robert Carlyle also expressed that he 'd have to make a decision about his future on the show by the end of that month . In March 2017 , several sources had reported that four of the current main cast members in particular - Morrison , Carlyle , Lana Parrilla , and Colin O'Donoghue - were in negotiations to renew their contracts for a potential seventh season . In April 2017 , Horowitz and Kitsis confirmed that a group of characters will indeed have their stories wrapped up by the end of the season in acknowledging the potential cast changes , saying : `` We planned this finale from the beginning of the year , so whoever stays and whoever goes ... all those questions have already been dealt with . The audience does not have to fear ( anything feeling ) incomplete . '' On May 8 , Morrison confirmed that she had declined an offer to remain on the show and that the sixth season would be her last , signaling the end of Emma 's time on the show as the main protagonist . On May 11 , Rebecca Mader announced that she would also be leaving the show at the end of the season , citing creative decisions beyond her control . On May 12 , season six was announced to be the last for four additional main actors : Ginnifer Goodwin , Josh Dallas , Jared Gilmore , and Emilie de Ravin . Thus , characters seeing their storylines wrapped up in the season six finale include Emma Swan , Snow White , Prince Charming , Belle , and Zelena . The season finale revealed that Henry Mills will remain a series protagonist , with the setting shifting to a later time period in which he is portrayed as an adult by Andrew J. West .  Musical episode ( edit ) Main article : The Song in Your Heart  In January 2017 , TV Line reported that the series would feature a musical episode later in the season . Creators Kitsis and Horowitz had spoken about the desire to do a musical installment previously , but did n't `` even know where to begin . '' Kitsis and Horowitz confirmed the report in February . They have also since confirmed that the episode will feature 7 original songs , including solos by Jennifer Morrison and Rebecca Mader , as well as a `` sing - off '' musical number featuring the Evil Queen and the Charmings . Composers Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner will be writing the original numbers featured , with arrangements provided by the show 's long - time composer Mark Isham . Kitsis and Hororwitz spoke about the nature of the episode saying , `` It actually is a huge part of the mythology of the show and there are some big things that happen in the episode , frankly , it 's been one of the challenges of doing the musical because we never wanted to do something where it was just like a to - the - side , one - off thing , and then get back to the main story . We want to see it part of the main story , which meant we had to really plan out this season with some great detail . ''   Casting ( edit )  Horowitz : There certainly are nods to the film that we all love so much , that we 're peppering in throughout . We 're , right now , focusing on ( Aladdin , Jasmine , and Jafar ) . Kitsis : Obviously , I do n't think we would touch the genie . I would like to see a monkey but I ca n't promise anything . I think , whereas some stories , like Frozen , we were very faithful to Frozen , I think you will see Aladdin will have its own Once twist .  -- Executive producers Kitsis and Horowitz on Once 's interpretation of Aladdin .

       "  'document_text_clean': \"Gun laws in Georgia - wikipedia  Gun laws in Georgia  Jump to : navigation , search  Gun laws in the state of Georgia regulate the sale , possession , and use of firearms and ammunition in the state of Georgia in the United States . It does not however affect the laws of other states . The Georgia Constitution , like many other state constitutions , guarantees to its citizen the right to keep and bear arms . Article one , section one , paragraph VII of the Georgia Constitution states : `` The right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed , but the General Assembly shall have the power to prescribe the manner in which arms may be borne . ''  Location of Georgia in the United States    Contents  ( hide )   1 Overview   2 Summary table   3 See also   4 References      Overview ( edit )   On June 8 , 2010 , Senate Bill 308 was signed by Governor Sonny Perdue reforming and clarifying many of Georgia 's Gun Laws , while leaving certain restrictions in place .   Georgia is a `` shall issue '' state , with the Georgia Weapons Carry License application to be submitted through the probate court of the county of residence .   Georgia reciprocates in recognizing firearms licenses with the following states : Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , Colorado , Florida , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maine , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , New Hampshire , North Carolina , North Dakota , Ohio , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Utah , Virginia , West Virginia , Wisconsin , and Wyoming .   South Carolina H3799 was signed by Gov Haley on June 3 , 2016 , allowing reciprocity with Georgia CCW permits .   There are a number of ways a firearm can be carried without a permit . No permit is needed :    To carry a firearm in a person 's home , place of business , or vehicle   To carry a long gun in a fully open and exposed manner   To carry an unloaded firearm in a case   To carry a firearm in someone else 's vehicle , provided you would qualify for a permit   To carry a firearm while fishing or hunting , if you have a valid fishing or hunting license    State preemption laws prohibit localities from regulating the ownership , transportation , and possession of firearms . Georgia also has a law preventing localities from enacting ordinances or lawsuits to classify gun ranges as nuisances . This means that local parks , offices , etc. of non-Federal government agencies may not prohibit those with a valid Georgia Weapons License from carrying . Federal regulations continue to prohibit carrying weapons on Corps of Engineers and US Postal Service property .  Beyond a few exceptions , a person may not carry a handgun openly in Georgia without having a valid GWCL  Firearm regulations are uniform throughout the state , and a firearms permit is valid throughout the state , in all areas other than in a few specially - defined areas . These specially - defined prohibited areas include :    In a government building , where ingress into such building is restricted or screened by security personnel and overseen by a POST certified swore peace officer   In a courthouse   In a jail or prison   In a place of worship , unless the governing body or authority of the place of worship permits the carrying of weapons or long guns by license holders   In a state mental health facility   On the premises of a nuclear power facility   Within 150 feet ( 46 m ) of any polling place , only during an election .   On school grounds ( incl . building and grounds ) , unless carrying or picking up a student , or permitted in writing by an official of the school , however weapons may be securely stored in vehicles parked on school grounds .    As exceptions to the above list , a person may keep their firearm in a locked compartment of their vehicle at any of the above places except nuclear power facilities . Also , a person may approach security or management of any of the above places ( except schools and nuclear power facilities ) and ask them for directions on removing , securing , storing , or temporarily surrendering the weapon .   As of July 1 , 2006 , Georgia became a `` Stand Your Ground '' state , and requires no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self - defense , or defense of others .   Georgia law allows private firearm sales between residents without requiring any processing through an FFL .   A Kennesaw , GA city ordinance requires that all homeowners own a firearm and ammunition ( Sec 34 - 1a ) . No one has ever been charged with violating this ordinance . An amendment exempts those who conscientiously object to owning a firearm , convicted felons , those who can not afford a firearm , and those with a mental or physical disability that would prevent them from owning a firearm .   As of the 23rd of April , 2014 , Georgia 's gun laws were drastically revised when Governor Nathan Deal signed House Bill 60 , or the Safe Carry Protection Act , into action . The Safe Carry Protection Act changed many of the currently enacted gun laws in place beforehand .   In 2017 , the Georgia legislature passed HB 280 , which allows for concealed carry permit holders to carry concealed handguns on public college campuses . Governor Nathan Deal signed it into law on May 4 , 2017 . The law took effect July 1 , 2017 on all University System of Georgia Campuses , including universities , colleges , and trade schools under the University System . Under HB280 any Georgia Weapons Licensee may carry on University System of Georgia property if they are carrying concealed . They may not carry in any dormitory or Greek house owned by the University System , in any athletic venue used for intercollegiate sports , in any daycare facility on campus with limited entry ( gated ) , in any classroom with a currently enrolled high school student , in any private office space , or in any room currently in use for disciplinary proceedings . HB280 does not remove the prohibition against carry on private university and college property under Georgia Law .

( March 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )    ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Broadcasting syndication is the license to broadcast television programs and radio programs by multiple television stations and radio stations , without going through a broadcast network . It is common in the United States where broadcast programming is scheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates . Syndication is less of a practice in the rest of the world , as most countries have centralized networks or television stations without local affiliates ; although less common , shows can be syndicated internationally . The three main types of syndication are `` first - run syndication '' , which is programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show and is made specifically to sell directly into syndication ; `` off - network syndication '' , which is the licensing of a program that was originally run on network TV or , in some cases , first - run syndication ( colloquially called a `` rerun '' ) ; and `` public broadcasting syndication '' .

Reruns are usually found on stations affiliated with smaller networks like Fox or The CW , especially since these networks broadcast one less hour of prime time network programming than the Big Three television networks and far less network - provided daytime television ( only one hour for The CW , none at all for Fox ) . A show usually enters off - network syndication when it has built up about four seasons ' worth or between 80 and 100 episodes , though for some genres the number could be as low as 65 . Successful shows in syndication can cover production costs and make a profit , even if the first run of the show was not profitable .   Public broadcasting syndication   This type of syndication has arisen in the U.S. as a parallel service to member stations of the Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) and the handful of independent public broadcasting stations . This form of syndication more closely resembles the news agency model , where nominally competing networks share resources and rebroadcast each other 's programs . For example , National Public Radio ( NPR ) stations commonly air the Public Radio Exchange 's This American Life , which may contain stories produced by NPR journalists .    When syndicating a show , the production company , or a distribution company called a syndicator , attempts to license the show to one station in each media market or area , or to a commonly owned station group , within the country and internationally . If successful , this can be lucrative , but the syndicator may only be able to license the show in a small percentage of the markets . Syndication differs from licensing the show to a television network . Once a network picks up a show , it is usually guaranteed to run on most or all the network 's affiliates on the same day of the week and at the same time ( in a given time zone , in countries where this is a concern ) . Some production companies create their shows and license them to networks at a loss , at least at first , hoping that the series will succeed and that eventual off - network syndication will turn a profit for the show . A syndicated program is licensed to stations for `` cash '' ( the stations purchase the rights to insert some or all of the advertisements at their level ) ; given to stations for access to airtime ( wherein the syndicators get the advertising revenue ) ; or the combination of both . The trade of program for airtime is called `` barter . ''   In the United States ( as a result of continued relaxation of station ownership regulations since the 1970s ) , syndicated programs are usually licensed to stations on a group level , with multiple stations owned and / or operated by the same broadcasting group carrying the program in different markets ( except in areas where another station holds the market rights to the program ) -- making it increasingly more efficient for syndicators to gain widespread national clearances for their programs . Many syndicated programs are traditionally sold first to one of five `` key '' station groups ( ABC Owned Television Stations , NBC Owned Television Stations , CBS Television Stations , Fox Television Stations and Tribune Broadcasting ) , allowing their programs to gain clearances in the largest U.S. TV markets ( such as New York City , Los Angeles , Chicago and Philadelphia , where all five aforementioned groups each own stations ) , before striking deals with other major and smaller station owners . Shows airing in first - run syndication that are carried primarily by an owned - and - operated station of a network may sometimes be incorrectly referenced as a network program , regardless to its distribution to stations of varying network affiliations and despite the fact it is not part of an individual network 's base schedule .   Since the early 2000s , some programs being proposed for national distribution in first - run syndication have been test marketed on a selected number of or all stations owned by certain major station group , allowing the distributor to determine whether a national roll - out is feasible based on the ratings accrued in the selected markets where the program is being aired .   While market penetration can vary widely and revenues can be unreliable , the producers often enjoy more content freedom in the absence of network 's standards and practices departments ; frequently , some innovative ideas are explored by first - run syndicated programming which the networks are leery of giving airtime to . Meanwhile , top - rated syndicated shows in the United States usually have a domestic market reach as high as 98 % . Very often , series ' that are aired in syndication have reduced running times . For example , a standard American sitcom runs 22 minutes , but in syndication it may be reduced to 20 minutes to make room for more commercials .   Syndication can take the form of either weekly or daily syndication . Game shows , some `` tabloid '' and entertainment news shows , and talk shows are broadcast daily on weekdays , while most other first - run syndicated shows are broadcast on a weekly basis and are usually aired on weekends only . Big discussion occurred in the 1990s and 2000s about whether previously aired episodes of a show could become syndicated while new episodes of it continued to air on its original network . There had been much opposition to this idea and it was generally viewed to lead to the death of the show . However , licensing a program for syndication actually resulted in the increased popularity for shows that remained in production . A prime example is Law & Order .   First - run syndication in the U.S. ( edit )   As with radio in the U.S. , television networks , particularly in their early years , did not offer a full day 's worth of programming for their affiliates , even in the evening or `` prime time '' hours . In the early days of television , this was less of an issue , as there were in most markets fewer TV stations than there were networks ( at the time four ) , which meant that the stations that did exist affiliated with multiple networks and , when not airing network or local programs , typically signed off . The loosening of licensing restrictions , and the subsequent passage of the All - Channel Receiver Act , meant that by the early 1960s , the situation had reversed . There were now more stations than the networks , now down to three after the failure of the DuMont Television Network , could serve . Some stations were not affiliated with any network , operating as independent stations . Both groups sought to supplement their locally produced programming with content that could be flexibly scheduled . The development of videotape and , much later , enhanced satellite downlink access furthered these options . While most past first - run syndicated shows were shown only in syndication , some canceled network shows continued to be produced for first - run syndication or were revived for syndication several years after their original cancellation . Until about 1980 , most syndicated series were distributed to stations either on 16mm film prints ( off - network reruns , feature films , and cartoons ) or videotape ( topical series such as the talk shows of Mike Douglas and Merv Griffin , and variety and quiz shows . )   Ziv Television Programs , Inc. , after establishing itself as a major radio syndicator , was the first major first - run television syndicator , creating several long - lived series in the 1950s and selling them directly to regional sponsors , who in turn sold the shows to local stations . Ziv 's first major TV hit was The Cisco Kid . Ziv had the foresight to film the Cisco Kid series in color , even though color TV was still in its infancy and most stations did not yet support the technology . Among the most widely seen Ziv offerings were Sea Hunt , I Led Three Lives , Highway Patrol and Ripcord . Some first - run syndicated series were picked up by networks in the 1950s and early 1960s , such as the Adventures of Superman and Mr. Ed . The networks began syndicating their reruns in the late 1950s , and first - run syndication shrank sharply , for a decade . Some stalwart series continued , including Death Valley Days ; other ambitious projects were also to flourish , however briefly , such as The Play of the Week ( 1959 -- 1961 ) , produced by David Susskind ( of the syndicated talk show Open End and also producer of such network fare as NYPD ) .   Among other syndicated series of the 1950s were MCA 's The Abbott and Costello Show ( vaudeville - style comedy ) and Guild Films ' Liberace ( musical variety ) and Life With Elizabeth , a domestic situation comedy that introduced Betty White to a national audience . In addition to the Adventures of Superman , many other series were based on comic strips and aimed at the juvenile audience , including Flash Gordon , Dick Tracy , Sheena , Queen of the Jungle , and Joe Palooka . Original juvenile adventure series included Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion , Cowboy G - Men , and Ramar of the Jungle . Series based on literary properties included Sherlock Holmes , Long John Silver ( based on Treasure Island ) , and The Three Musketeers . Several of these were co-productions between U.S. and European ( usually British ) companies . Crusader Rabbit pioneered in the area of first - run animated series ; followed by Bucky and Pepito , Colonel Bleep , Spunky and Tadpole , Q.T. Hush , and others . ( All of these were five - minute shorts designed to be placed within locally hosted kiddie shows . ) Syndicated sports programming included Championship Bowling and All - Star Golf , both produced by Chicago - based Walter Schwimmer , Inc .   In addition to regular series , syndicators also offered packages of feature films , cartoons , and short subjects originally made for movie theatres . Until late in the 1950s , however , much of the theatrical product available consisted of low - budget secondary features ( mainly Westerns ) with relatively few notable stars . One syndication company , National Telefilm Associates , attempted to create a `` film network '' of stations showing its lineup of first - run series , which included syndicated programs such as Police Call ( 1955 ) , How to Marry a Millionaire ( 1957 - 1959 ) , The Passerby , Man Without a Gun ( 1957 - 1959 ) , and This is Alice ( 1958 ) . The venture lasted five years and closed down in 1961 .   By the late 1960s , a de facto two - tiered system had developed in the United States , with the major network affiliates ( usually on longer - range VHF stations ) consistently were drawing more viewers than their UHF , independent counterparts ; syndicators thus hoped to get their programs onto the major network stations , where spots in the lineup were far more scarce . FCC rulings in 1971 curtailed the U.S. networks ' ability to schedule programming in what has become known as the `` early fringe '' , notably the 7 -- 8 p.m. ( Eastern and Pacific Time ) hour of `` prime time '' , with the stated hope that this might encourage more local programming of social and cultural relevance to communities ( off - network syndicated repeats were also banned ) ; some projects of this sort came to fruition , though usually relatively commercial and slick ones such as Group W 's Evening Magazine / PM Magazine franchise , and such pre-existing national projects as the brief commercial - television run of William F. Buckley , Jr. 's interview / debate series Firing Line . The more obvious result was an increase in Canadian - produced syndicated dramatic series , such as Dusty 's Trail and the Colgate - sponsored Dr. Simon Locke . Game shows , often evening editions of network afternoon series , flourished , and a few odd items such as Wild Kingdom , canceled by NBC in 1971 , had a continuing life as syndicated programming tailor - made for the early fringe .   1970s and 1980s ( edit )   In 1971 , the U.S. Federal Communications Commission passed the Prime Time Access Rule and Financial Interest and Syndication Rules , which prevented networks from programming one particular hour of prime time programming on its television stations each night and required the networks to spin off their syndication arms as independent companies . Although the intent of the rule was to encourage local stations to produce their own programs for this time slot , budgetary limits instead prompted stations to buy syndicated programs to fill the slot . This , coupled with an increase in UHF independent stations , caused a boom in the syndication market . In the 1970s , first - run syndication continued to be an odd mix : cheaply produced , but not always poor quality , `` filler '' programming . These included the dance - music show Soul Train , and 20th Century Fox 's That 's Hollywood , a television variation on the popular That 's Entertainment ! theatrically released collections of film clips from the Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer library .   There were also many imported programs distributed this way . These include the documentary series Wild , Wild World of Animals ( repackaged by Time - Life with narration by William Conrad ) and Thames Television 's sober and necessarily grim The World at War . The Starlost ( 1973 ) was a Canadian series , apparently modified from the vision of science fiction writers Harlan Ellison and Ben Bova . Britain 's ITC Entertainment , headed by Lew Grade , made UFO ( 1970 ) and Space : 1999 ( 1975 ) . These two series were created by Gerry Anderson ( and his associates ) , who was previously best known for Supermarionation ( a combination of puppetry and animation ) series such as Thunderbirds . The most successful syndicated show in the United States in the 1970s was probably The Muppet Show , also from Lew Grade 's company . Animated series from the 1980s Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds and Around the World with Willy Fog came from Spanish animation production company BRB Internacional and their Japanese co-producers Nippon Animation .   Game shows thrived in syndication during the decade . Nightly versions of What 's My Line ? , Truth or Consequences , Beat the Clock and To Tell the Truth premiered in the late 1960s and found loyal audiences for many years . Several daytime network games began producing once - a-week nighttime versions for broadcast in the early evening hours , usually with bigger prizes and often featuring different hosts ( emcees were limited to appearing on one network and one syndicated game simultaneously ) and modified titles ( Match Game PM , The $100,000 Name That Tune or The $25,000 Pyramid , for example ) . A few independent game shows , such as Sports Challenge and Celebrity Bowling , also entered the syndication market around this time . Of these shows , Let 's Make a Deal and Hollywood Squares were the first to jump to twice - a-week syndicated versions around 1973 . Another popular daytime show to have a weekly syndicated version was The Price Is Right , which began concurrently in weekly syndication and on CBS ; the syndicated `` nighttime '' version was hosted by Dennis James for its first five years , after which daytime host Bob Barker took over for another three years of weekly episodes ( even though , by this point , the daytime and nighttime shows had diverged noticeably ) . The nighttime version of Family Feud ( 1977 ) quickly jumped from once - weekly to twice , and finally to five - day - a-week airings , and its massive popularity , along with that of new five - day - a-week entries like Jack Barry 's The Joker 's Wild ( 1977 ) and Tic - Tac - Dough ( 1978 ) and Chuck Barris 's increasingly raunchy remakes of his 1960s hits The Newlywed Game and The Dating Game , brought an end ( with rare exceptions ) to the era of once - a-week games . Also popular in first - run syndication and daytime was The Gong Show , hosted by Barris throughout most of its run ( Gary Owens hosted the first syndicated season ) .   A number of half - hour musical - variety shows were also offered in the early 1970s , generally built around personable middle - of - the - road singers like Bobby Vinton , Bobby Goldsboro , Dolly Parton , and Andy Williams , or groups like Sha Na Na , The Johnny Mann Singers , and The Golddiggers . Wait Till Your Father Gets Home ( 1972 ) was a Hanna - Barbera cartoon series attempting to ape the All in the Family - style sitcoms ; Skippy the Bush Kangaroo ( 1969 ) , an Australian children 's series , or Gentle Ben ( a decade later , the decidedly not - for - children Australian Prisoner : Cell Block H would have a brief U.S. syndicated run ) ; and a Canadian sketch - comedy series began appearing on U.S. television stations in 1977 -- Second City Television , which would eventually find a home , for two seasons , on NBC , as SCTV Network 90 ( and on premium cable channel Cinemax by 1983 ) .   The Universal / Paramount - produced package of original programming , Operation Prime Time , began appearing on ad hoc quasi-networks of ( almost by necessity ) non-network stations in the U.S. in 1978 , with a mini-series adaptation of John Jakes 's The Bastard . From the later 1960s into the late 1970s , Westinghouse also found considerable success with The Mike Douglas Show , a variety / talk show hosted by a singer with an easygoing interview style , which aired in the afternoons in most markets ; similar programs soon followed featuring Merv Griffin , who had been the host of CBS ' most sustained late - night answer to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson previously , and another network veteran , Dinah Shore . Also notable was the growing success of audience - participation talk shows , particularly that of the innovator of the format , Phil Donahue .   First - run syndication in the 1970s also made it possible for some shows that were no longer wanted by television networks to remain on the air . In 1971 , ABC canceled The Lawrence Welk Show , which went on to produce new episodes in syndication for another 11 years , and currently continues to much success in weekend reruns ( with new segments featuring Welk cast members inserted within the episodes ) distributed to PBS stations by the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority . Also in 1971 , CBS dropped Lassie and Hee Haw , the latter show 's run ending as part of the network 's cancellation of all of its rural - oriented shows ( known then as `` rural purge '' , which also resulted in the cancellations of The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres ) . Lassie entered first - run syndication for two years , while Hee Haw continued to produce new episodes until 1992 .  First - run syndicated comedy ( edit ) Main article : List of sitcoms broadcast in first - run syndication  Throughout the mid-to - late 1980s into the early 1990s , sitcoms continued to enter first - run syndication after being canceled by the networks , the most successful of which were Mama 's Family and Charles In Charge . Other sitcoms during this time to enter first - run syndication after network cancellation included Silver Spoons , Punky Brewster , Webster , It 's a Living , Too Close for Comfort , 9 to 5 , What 's Happening ! ! , and WKRP in Cincinnati . Many of these sitcoms produced new shows in syndication mainly to have enough episodes for a profitable run in reruns . Other sitcoms , such as Small Wonder , Out of This World , The Munsters Today , and Harry and the Hendersons ( as well as more action - adventure oriented series like Superboy and My Secret Identity ) enjoyed success in syndication throughout their entire run .  Dramatic first - run syndicated programs ( edit )  The broadcast networks aired many action - adventure programs from the 1950s to the 1980s . By the late 1980s , however , increasing production costs made them less attractive to the networks . Studios found that reruns of one - hour dramas did not sell as well as sitcoms , so they were unable to fully recoup the shows ' costs using the traditional deficit financing model . When NBC canceled the television series adaptation of Fame after only two seasons , the producers made special arrangements with LBS Communications , which resulted in MGM reviving the series for first - run syndication in the fall of 1983 , where it continued for four more seasons , with the last first - run episode airing in the U.S. on May 18 , 1987 .   Star Trek : The Next Generation debuted in 1987 , and became the most - watched syndicated show throughout its seven - year run . Its great success caused many others to debut . Friday the 13th : The Series ( a horror series which shared its title with the successful movie franchise ) also debuted in 1987 . The next syndicated shows that debuted in 1988 were War of the Worlds and Freddy 's Nightmares . Baywatch , which debuted in 1989 on NBC and was canceled after one season also became one of the most watched syndicated shows throughout its ten - year - run , garnering a worldwide audience .   By 1994 , there were more than 20 one - hour syndicated shows . Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Renegade were also syndicated . Hercules : The Legendary Journeys and its spin - off series Xena : Warrior Princess were also popular , often tying Deep Space Nine at 5 % to 6 % of the Nielsen - monitored audience . Forever Knight drew devoted `` cult '' audiences ( 3 % rating ) . Psi Factor and Poltergeist : The Legacy attempted to draw on the audience for the Fox series The X-Files ( as did the short - lived spinoff Baywatch Nights ) . Among the other series were Relic Hunter , VIP , High Tide , She Spies and Once a Thief .   Babylon 5 began life in 1993 on the Prime Time Entertainment Network ( PTEN ) , moved into syndicated distribution when its network was displaced by WB / UPN - affiliated stations , and eventually ended its final season on TNT ( 1998 ) . In 1997 Earth : Final Conflict , based on ideas from Gene Roddenberry , premiered in syndication . Three years later , a second Gene Roddenberry series , Andromeda also premiered in syndication . As emerging networks WB and UPN signed contracts with formerly - independent stations , and the syndication market shrunk , Andromeda season 5 moved to the Syfy Channel ( 2004 ) .   There would not be a first - run syndicated drama ( or a first - run scripted series in syndication ) until 2008 , when Disney - ABC Domestic Television and ABC Studios teamed up with Sam Raimi to launch a new first - run syndicated series , Legend of the Seeker , based on Terry Goodkind 's Sword of Truth novel series . Another gap in first - run scripted series in syndication followed for four years after Legend of the Seeker was canceled in 2009 , until Trifecta Entertainment & Media ( a company that mainly distributes programs for off - network syndication ) began producing SAF3 ( pronounced `` safe '' ) in 2013 .  Animated series ( edit ) Main articles : List of animated television series created for syndication and Weekday cartoon  During the late 1970s and 1980s , independent stations signed on in mid-sized and many small markets . The market for made - for - television cartoons grew as a result to include a branch for such stations . It usually had a greater artistic freedom , and looser standards ( not mandated by a network ) . The older Bugs Bunny and Popeye cartoons made way for first - run syndicated cartoons such as He - Man and the Masters of the Universe , Inspector Gadget , ThunderCats , My Little Pony , The Transformers , G.I. Joe , Voltron , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , and reruns of Scooby - Doo , Garfield and Friends , and The Pink Panther , among many others .   In 1987 , The Walt Disney Company tried its luck at syndication ; DuckTales premiered that September and would eventually last for 100 episodes . The success of DuckTales paved the way for a second series two years later , Chip ' n Dale Rescue Rangers . The following year , the two shows aired together under the umbrella block The Disney Afternoon . In the fall of 1990 , Disney added another hour to The Disney Afternoon ; the block continued in syndication , running additional first - run animated series until 1999 .   These cartoons initially competed with the ones that were nationally televised on the broadcast networks . In the 1980s , national broadcast networks only aired cartoons on Saturday mornings , not competing with the weekday and Sunday syndication blocks aired by local independent stations ; however , by the 1990s , Fox and then The WB launched their own weekday afternoon children 's program blocks . By the end of the 1990s , both syndication distributors and broadcast networks ended up losing most of its children 's market to the rise of cable television channels aimed at that audience such as Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network , which provided appealing children 's entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours .   Syndication remains a method of choice for distributing children 's programming , although this has gradually shifted to only produce programs to satisfy the federally mandated `` educational - informational '' ( E / I ) rule imposed in the late 1990s as part of an amendment to the Children 's Television Act of 1990 that requires stations to air three hours of educational children 's programs every week , regardless of the station 's format . Syndication is generally a less expensive option for a local station than to attempt to produce its own locally originated E / I programming ; not all networks provide their own E / I programs , so stations that are affiliated with networks that do not carry children 's program blocks acquire E / I programs off the syndication market to fulfill the requirements .  News programming and late - night talk shows ( edit )  Also in the 1980s , news programming of various sorts began to be offered widely to stations . Independent Network News , which was produced by WPIX in New York City , was a half - hour nightly program that ran from 1980 to 1990 on independent stations ( in some markets , INN was paired with a locally produced primetime newscast ) ; CNN would offer a simulcast of programming from its sister network Headline News ( now HLN ) to broadcast stations later , though it was used mainly to fill overnight time periods and was effectively discontinued in syndication with the 2006 launch of that network 's `` Headline Prime '' talk show block . Entertainment Tonight began its long and continuing run as a `` soft '' news daily strip , with a number of imitations following ( among which have included such entertainment news shows as TMZ on TV , Extra and ET 's own spin - off The Insider ) ; and `` tabloid '' television , in the wake of ABC 's 20 / 20 and , more immediately , 20th Television 's A Current Affair , would become a syndication staple with such series as Hard Copy and Real TV .   Another area where network dominance was challenged by syndicated programming in the 1980s was with late - night talk shows ; The Arsenio Hall Show was the only very successful one ( it would be canceled after five years in 1994 due to ratings declines spurred by many CBS affiliates pushing the show to later timeslots following the debut of the Late Show with David Letterman , and was later revived in 2013 ) , but similar programs were attempted such as Alan Thicke 's earlier short - lived Thicke of the Night , Lauren Hutton 's innovatively shot Lauren Hutton and ... , and talk shows hosted by Dennis Miller , Whoopi Goldberg , David Brenner and Keenen Ivory Wayans ; Magic Johnson 's The Magic Hour was seen as a massive flop , similar to Thicke of the Night . The popularity of syndicated talk shows fell dramatically in the mid-1990s as network and cable offerings expanded in the wake of Johnny Carson 's retirement .  Reality and live - action children 's shows ( edit )  Long before their popularity on network television from the 2000s onward , reality competition shows in one form or another , such as Star Search and American Gladiators , enjoyed popularity in syndication as early as the mid-1980s . Since the now - defunct networks UPN and The WB began offering their affiliates additional nights of prime time programming in the late 1990s , there have been fewer first - run scripted series in syndication , at least , in the U.S. ; much as with the closing of windows that provided opportunity for Ziv in the 1950s and various producers in the early 1970s . The more expensive dramatic projects are less attractive to syndicators ( particularly when they might be sold , with somewhat less risk , to cable channels ) ; `` reality '' series such as Cheaters and Maximum Exposure and several dating series began to be more common in the early 2000s . Some of the more low - key programs in this category were designed to appeal to children , such as Beakman 's World , Disney 's Sing Me A Story with Belle , Animal Rescue and Jack Hanna 's Animal Adventures . They were able to get significant clearance because of stricter Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) enforcement of rules on children 's television programming .  Game shows ( edit )  Several game shows are currently syndicated ; historically , the most popular has been Wheel of Fortune and the current version of Jeopardy ! , both created by television personality Merv Griffin , respectively premiering in 1983 and 1984 . The shows have been # 1 and # 2 or # 1 to # 3 in the syndication ratings consistently since at least the late 1980s . In fact , according to the Guinness Book of World Records , Wheel is the most popular syndicated television program both within and outside the United States . Family Feud ended its first syndication run in 1985 . Three years later , a revival of the program featuring Ray Combs as host became a moderate hit and continued for seven seasons , its last year featuring the return of original host Richard Dawson in a failed attempt to save the series . A third revival hit the airwaves in 1999 and has gone through four hosts . The first three hosts ( Louie Anderson , Richard Karn and John O'Hurley ) struggled in their respective runs and only lasted three to four years . The current run of the program , hosted by Steve Harvey , has been a major ratings success ; on the week of June 12 , 2015 , for the first time ever , Family Feud was the highest - rated syndicated program in terms of average household ratings . A Hollywood Squares revival also thrived beginning in 1998 , running six seasons until its 2004 cancellation . By far the most successful entry into the market in the 2000s has been the daily version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , which premiered in 2002 .   Because game shows are very inexpensive to produce , with many episodes completed each day of production , successful ones are very profitable ; for example , in 1988 Jeopardy ! cost an estimated $5 million to produce but earned almost $50 million in revenue . New game show concepts ( that is , not based on an existing or pre-existing format ) are rarely tried and usually unsuccessful in syndication ; somewhat of an exception to this was Street Smarts , which lasted from 2001 to 2006 ( despite the series airing in late night slots in many markets ) . Between 2003 and 2007 , no new game shows debuted in syndication , marking four consecutive seasons where no new shows with that genre debuted , a syndication first . That streak ended with the fall 2007 debuts of Temptation and Merv Griffin 's Crosswords , bringing the daytime tally to six game shows ; both ended production after one year , though Crosswords aired in reruns in some cities during the 2008 -- 09 season before those reruns moved exclusively to cable .   More new shows were added for the 2008 -- 09 fall season , including a daytime run of Deal or No Deal ( which featured certain elements that differed from the show 's franchised format , most notably with prospective players instead of models holding briefcases that held the monetary amounts ) and an adaptation of the popular board game Trivial Pursuit . While Deal caught on and was renewed for the 2009 -- 2010 season , Trivial Pursuit : America Plays suffered low ratings throughout its run and was canceled .   For the 2009 -- 2010 season , the Fox game show Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader ? moved to syndication with a new , less expensive format . Do n't Forget the Lyrics ! followed for the 2010 -- 2011 season . Deal , suffering from falling ratings , was canceled in February 2010 , with the final episodes airing in late May of that same year . 5th Grader and Do n't Forget the Lyrics were canceled the following year for the same reason ( although reruns of 5th Grader remain on cable ) . Reruns of the popular Discovery Channel show Cash Cab began airing in syndication in January 2011 . Reruns of the GSN dating game show Baggage first aired in syndication as a test run in early 2011 on stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group , which preceded its full launch into other markets in fall 2012 ; although it was removed from syndication after one season .   The 2014 - 15 season saw the introduction of Celebrity Name Game , hosted by former The Late Late Show host Craig Ferguson ; the series was renewed for a second season in January 2015 , while Ferguson would also win a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host for his work on the program . In January 2016 , Fox owned - and - operated stations began a test run of South of Wilshire -- a game show produced by TMZ . The 2017 summer season includes the game show `` iWitness '' created by TV judge Judith Sheindlin .  Stripped talk shows ( edit )  The dominant form of first - run syndication in the U.S. for the last three decades has been the `` stripped '' ( or `` strip '' ) talk show , such as Donahue , Oprah Winfrey , The Tyra Banks Show , and The Jerry Springer Show . Strip programming is a technique used for scheduling television and radio programming to ensure consistency and coherency . Strip programming is used to deliver consistent content to targeted audiences . Broadcasters know or predict the times at which certain demographics will be listening to or watching their programs and play them at that time . As with game shows , talk shows are inexpensive to produce and very profitable if successful . In many markets , a stripped show will be seen twice daily , usually with different episodes ( one being a more recent episode and the other being an episode from a previous season ) . Sometimes , station groups with more than one station in a market , or a `` duopoly '' , will run one episode of a strip on one of their stations in the morning , and the other available episode on another of their stations that night .   Meanwhile , the popularity of some of the audience - participation talk shows continues to encourage new participants , some of whom , such as Morton Downey , Jr. and Rosie O'Donnell , have brief periods of impressive ratings and influence ; others , such as Oprah Winfrey and Maury Povich , have a sustained run . A notable scheduling decision was made by KRON - TV in San Francisco : a 2000 dispute with NBC led to that station 's disaffiliation from that network after 52 years , and since all the other larger networks were already represented in San Francisco , KRON decided to become one of the largest commercial independent stations by market size on the VHF band in the U.S. , and soon tried running Dr. Phil , a popular new stripped series hosted by Winfrey - associate Phil McGraw , in primetime , with impressive ratings results .   2000s ( edit )  Main article : First - run syndication in the United States , 2000s  First - run syndicated shows in the United States include talk shows ( e.g. , The Dr. Oz Show , Dr. Phil and The Ellen DeGeneres Show ) ; tabloid / newsmagazine shows ( e.g. , TMZ Live ) ; crime / law enforcement shows ( e.g. , Crime Watch Daily ) ; game shows ( e.g. , Family Feud , Jeopardy ! and Wheel of Fortune ) ; reality court shows ( e.g. , Judge Judy ) ; and sitcoms ( e.g. , The First Family ) .   Influence on television schedules ( edit )   In earlier times , independent stations thrived on syndicated programming , including some venerable and quite profitable stations such as KMSP - TV in the Minneapolis - St. Paul market . With the loosening of FCC regulations and the creation of new additional broadcast networks ( such as Fox , The CW , MyNetworkTV and Ion Television ) , most of these independents have joined one or another of these or smaller ( religious or low - budget ) networks .   In another case , like those of KCAL - TV in Los Angeles , KMCI - TV in Lawrence - Kansas City and WMLW - TV in Racine - Milwaukee , those independent stations are used to complement their network - affiliated sister station ( respectively in the mentioned cases , KCBS - TV , KSHB - TV and WDJT - TV ) by allowing a duopoly control of more syndicated programming than would be possible on one station ( and to spread it throughout the schedule of the two stations , often several times a day ) , or to air news programming in times unavailable on the larger network station , along with fulfilling network and syndicated programming commitments , which allows popular or network programming to be moved to the independent stations due to breaking news or sports commitments without the traditional inconvenience of a late night or weekend airing of the pre-empted show . A duopoly of a network - affiliated and independent station also allows a network station to move a low - rated syndicated program to their sister independent station to stem revenue losses .   Off - network syndication ( edit )   Off - network syndication occurs when a network television show is syndicated in packages containing some or all episodes , and sold to as many television stations and markets as possible to be used in local programming timeslots . In this manner , sitcoms are preferred and more successful because they are less serialized , and can be run non-sequentially , which is more beneficial and less costly for the station . In the United States , local stations now rarely broadcast reruns of primetime dramas ( or simply air them primarily on weekends ) ; instead , they usually air on basic cable channels , which may air each episode 30 to 60 times .   Syndication rights typically last for six consecutive showings of a series within three to five years ; if a program continues to perform well enough in broadcast or cable syndication during the initial cycle , television stations or cable networks can opt to renew an off - network program for an additional cycle .   Syndication has been known to spur the popularity of a series that only experienced moderate success during its network run . The best known example of this is the original series of Star Trek , which ran for three seasons on NBC from 1966 to 1969 , gaining only modest ratings , but became a worldwide phenomenon after it entered off - network syndication . Its success in syndication led to the Star Trek film series , Star Trek : The Next Generation , and the later versions in the franchise .   It is common for long - running series to have early seasons syndicated while the series itself is still in first - run network production . In order to differentiate between new and rebroadcast content , until the 1980s it was not uncommon for series to be syndicated under a different title than that used in their original broadcast run . Examples include Bonanza ( which was syndicated as Ponderosa ) , Gunsmoke ( as Marshall Dillon , a title still used to differentiate reruns from the early , half - hour and black - and - white episodes of the show from the later one - hour color episodes ) , Emergency ! ( as Emergency One ) , Ironside ( as The Raymond Burr Show ) , Hawaii Five - O ( as McGarrett ) , M * A * S * H ( as M * A * S * H 4077th ) , Marcus Welby , M.D. ( as Robert Young , Family Doctor ) , CHiPs ( as CHiPs Patrol ) , and Happy Days ( as Happy Days Again ) .   Syndication of older episodes can also increase exposure for a television show that is still airing first - run network episodes . In the case of the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory , its syndication , particularly on TBS , is one of the reasons attributed for a rise in first - run ratings for its sixth season . The sixth - season episode `` The Bakersfield Expedition '' , for example , was the first episode of that series to attract 20 million viewers .   Strip / daily syndication ( edit )   Off - network syndication can take several forms . The most common form is known as strip syndication or daily syndication , when episodes of a television series are shown daily five times a week in the same time slot . In the 1960s and 1970s , independent stations with no news departments began viewing strip syndication as a necessary means of obtaining effective counterprogramming to the local news programs airing on network affiliates . Typically , this means that enough episodes must exist ( 88 episodes , or four seasons , is the usual minimum , though many syndicators prefer a fully rounded 100 episodes ) to allow for continual strip syndication to take place over the course of several months , without episodes being repeated . However , there are exceptions , such as the 65 - episode block ( common in children 's programming ) , which allows for a 13 - week cycle of daily showings , so there will only be four repeats in a year .   In some cases , more than one episode is shown daily . Half - hour sitcoms are sometimes syndicated in groups of two or four episodes , taking up one or two hours of broadcast time . If a series is not strip syndicated , it may be aired once a week , instead of five times a week . This allows shows with fewer episodes to last long in syndication , but it also may mean viewers will tire of waiting a week for the next episode of a show they have already seen and stop watching . More often , hour - long dramas in their first several runs in syndication are offered weekly ; sitcoms are more likely to get stripped . In recent years , there has been something of a trend toward showing two consecutive episodes of a program on Saturday and Sunday nights after prime time ( generally following the local news ) . This pattern has been particularly prominent for shows which are still in production but have run long enough to have many previous episodes available .   As with commercial stations , not all the airtime nor all the perceived audience are met by the productions offered U.S. public - broadcasting stations by PBS ; additionally , there are some independent public television stations in the U.S. which take no programming from that ( somewhat ) decentralized network . As a result , there are several syndicators of programming for the non-profit stations , several of which are descendants of the regional station groups which combined some , not all , of their functions into the creation of PBS in 1969 . American Public Television ( APT ) is the largest of these , nearly matched by the National Educational Telecommunications Association ( NETA ) ; similarly , the now defunct Continental Program Marketing was another of the syndicator - descendants ( of the Northeastern , Southeastern , and Rocky Mountain educational networks , respectively ) of the pre-PBS era . Among the other notable organizations in the U.S. are Westlink Satellite Operations ( based at Albuquerque 's KNME ) , BBC Worldwide Americas ( which often works with other distributors and individual stations , since it has no satellite access of its own in the U.S. ) , Deutsche Welle , Executive Program Services , the Program Resource Group and PBS 's Long Island , New York member station WLIW , which is ( with the arguable exception of KNME ) the most prolific contributor of any individual station of syndicated programming , most obviously the BBC World News , Doctor Who and Monty Python 's Flying Circus in the U.S.   Off - network syndication in its various forms , including Internet , international and traditional direct - to - station sales , constitute roughly half of an individual television program 's overall revenue stream , with the other half taken up by advertising .

Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information . ( August 2013 )     In 1993 , Universal Studios became one of the first studios to cash in on the cable trend , first selling repeats of Major Dad to USA Network in 1993 for $600,000 per episode , the first time a network program was exclusively sold to a cable network for its first run rights . Later it sold reruns of Law & Order to A&E for about $155,000 an episode ; in 1996 , the studio got $275,000 from USA Network for repeats of New York Undercover , a far less successful show . Law & Order drew A&E 's highest daytime ratings -- one million viewers per episode .   Universal sold reruns of Xena : Warrior Princess and Hercules : The Legendary Journeys to USA Network for $300,000 each . And even long - forgotten shows can find new life : The Nashville Network bought The Dukes of Hazzard from Warner Bros. in 1997 for well over $10 million . USA Network paid $750,000 for the rights to Walker , Texas Ranger ; while USA 's reruns of the show drew an average of 2.3 million viewers -- outstanding by cable standards -- Perth says the show will need an enormous number of airings to have any sort of profitability .

Less popular programming may be distributed by barter , in which the syndicator , instead of selling the show to a station , offers the show for free , with the caveat that the station give up its advertising time on other shows to the syndicator 's advertisers . Barter syndication , in addition to the cost advantage , is popular because of its flexibility ; a station can typically pick up a barter syndicated program for only a few weeks or months , without the long - term financial commitment of a traditional syndicated series , allowing the station to plug the show into its lineup to fill a hole in the schedule .   Types of deals ( edit )   Cash deals are when a distributor offers a syndicated program to the highest bidder . A cash plus deal is when the distributor retains advertising space to offset some of the cost for the program . The station gets the program for a little less in exchange for some ad space for the producer .   Barter deals are usually for new untested shows or older shows . In this type of deal , distributors get a fraction of the advertisement revenue in exchange for their program . For example , in a 7 / 5 deal the producer gets seven minutes of advertising time , leaving five minutes for the station to insert local as well as national advertisements .   Radio syndication ( edit )   Radio syndication generally works the same way as television syndication , except that radio stations usually are not organized into strict affiliate - only networks . Radio networks generally are only distributors of radio shows , and individual stations ( though often owned by large conglomerates ) decide which shows to carry from a wide variety of networks and independent radio providers . As a result , radio networks such as WestwoodOne or Premiere Networks , despite their influence in broadcasting , are not as recognized among the general public as television networks like CBS or ABC ( many of these distributors ally themselves with television networks ; WestwoodOne , for instance , is allied with NBC , while Premiere is allied with Fox ) . Some examples of widely syndicated commercial broadcasting music programs include weekly countdowns like Rick Dees ' Weekly Top 40 , the American Top 40 , American Country Countdown with Kix Brooks , Canada 's Top 20 Countdown , the Canadian Hit 30 Countdown and the nightly program , Delilah , heard on many U.S. stations .   Syndication is particularly popular in talk radio . While syndicated music shows ( with the exception of some evening and overnight shows such as Delilah mentioned above ) tend to air once a week and are mostly recorded , most popular talk radio programs are syndicated daily and are broadcast live . Also , with relatively few 24 - hour live talk radio networks ( though this , in recent times , has been changing ) , most radio stations are free to assemble their own lineup of talk show hosts as they so choose . Examples of syndicated talk programs are Premiere Networks ' The Bob & Tom Show , Dial Global 's The Jim Bohannon Show , and the self - syndicated The Dave Ramsey Show ( more recently , talk networks such as Talk Radio Network have been marketing and packaging all - day lineups , marking a departure from the syndication model ; as such , popular shows such as Cumulus Media Networks ' The Savage Nation and Premiere 's The Rush Limbaugh Show now air as part of a broader network lineup in many markets , particularly on Premiere owned - and - operated stations , though they continue to be syndicated to non-network stations as well ) . Talk syndication tends to be more prevalent because voice tracking , a practice used by many music stations to have disc jockeys host multiple supposedly local shows at once , is not feasible with live talk radio .   National Public Radio , Public Radio International , and American Public Media all sell programming to local member stations in the U.S. , most of which are subsidized through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting but operated by private nonprofit organizations , universities , state or local governments . This is in contrast to centralized public radio networks in other countries ( such as Canada 's CBC , Australia 's ABC and the United Kingdom 's BBC ) that own and operate all of their stations as arms of the national government and run them as a strict network ( from 1948 to 2013 , the United States had a strict anti-propaganda law , the Smith -- Mundt Act , that prohibited broadcasting government - owned networks such as Voice of America to American audiences . The law was mostly repealed in 2013 , but distribution of VOA or other federally produced radio programming is still rare ) . Two independently produced , non-commercial syndicated programs , heard on hundreds of community radio and indie radio stations , are Alternative Radio and Democracy Now ! . Some ( in fact , most ) radio programs are also offered on a barter system usually at no charge to the radio station . The system is used for live programming or preproduced programs and include a mixture of ad time sold by the program producer as well as time set aside for the radio station to sell .   History ( edit )   Before radio networks matured in the United States , some early radio shows were reproduced on transcription disks and mailed to individual stations . An example of syndication using this method was RadiOzark Enterprises , Inc. based in Springfield , Missouri , co-owned with KWTO . The Assembly of God , with national headquarters in Springfield , sponsored a half - hour program on the station called Sermons in Song . RadiOzark began transcribing the show for other stations in the 1940s , and eventually 200 stations carried the program . The company later produced country music programs starring among others , Smiley Burnette , George Morgan , Bill Ring and Tennessee Ernie Ford ( 260 15 - minute episodes of The Tennessee Ernie Show were distributed ) , and more than 1,200 U.S. and Canadian stations aired the programs . Many syndicated radio programs were distributed through the U.S. mail or another delivery service , although the medium changed as technology developed , going from transcription disks to phonograph records , tape recordings , cassette tapes and eventually CDs . Many smaller weekend programs still use this method to this day , though with the rise of the Internet , many stations have since opted to distribute programs via CD - quality MP3s through FTP downloads .   It was not until the advent of satellite communications in the 1980s that live syndication became popular ( though it could be transmitted through network lines , it was not particularly common because of cost , network congestion and quality issues ) . Since then , most syndicated radio programs are distributed using satellite subcarrier audio technology . Shortly after satellite networks such as RKO , Transtar and SMN began , the Fairness Doctrine was repealed , which is credited with helping Rush Limbaugh become the first national talk radio superstar . At the same time , the FCC began issuing more FM radio licenses to suburban and rural areas in the late 1980s , which allowed more room for music stations on the FM dial ; radio formats such as country music that were traditionally AM fixtures even after most pop and rock music moved to FM were now moving to FM as well , leaving much more room for talk formats on the AM dial . As the 1990s went on , Dr. Laura and Howard Stern began their national shows , rising to become national icons . The Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which led to significant concentration of media ownership , facilitated the rapid deployment of both existing and new syndicated programs in the late 1990s , putting syndication on par with , and eventually surpassing , the network radio format .   After the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , syndicated talk radio saw a notably rapid rise in popularity , as networks rushed new national shows into syndication to meet the demand for discussion of national issues . Many of these , such as Laura Ingraham , Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck , were mostly supportive of the actions of the Republican - led government ; a few others , such as Alex Jones , were openly critical of the government 's actions and motives . After the Democrats took control in the late 2000s , the gap between the two styles narrowed due to the mutual opposition of both camps to the government 's actions , which allowed Jones greater clearance on stations .   In contrast to conservative talk radio , which has predominantly been driven by syndication , progressive talk radio has almost always been a network - driven model . The incompatibility of conservative and progressive ideologies and the lack of syndicated progressive hosts required solutions that could produce all - day programming to individual stations . It was not until Air America Radio launched in 2004 that progressive talk would become viable ; though it failed several years later , Dial Global now carries a network slate that is carried on most progressive talk stations . Sports radio is likewise mostly a network phenomenon , partially because the irregular nature of sports pre-emptions makes having a full - time network to be able to cut into and join in progress at any time highly convenient . Syndicated radio is not as popular in other parts of the world . Canada has a few independently syndicated shows , but the bulk of syndicated content there comes from the United States , and the sum total of syndicated programming is far less than most American stations , as Canadian stations rely more heavily on local content . Most other countries still follow the network radio model .   International syndication ( edit )   Syndication also applies to international markets . Same language countries often syndicate programs to each other -- such as programs from the United Kingdom being syndicated to Australia and vice versa . Another example would be programs from the United Kingdom , Mexico , Brazil , and Argentina being syndicated to local television stations in the United States , and programs from the United States being syndicated elsewhere in the world . One of the best - known internationally syndicated television series has been The Muppet Show , which was produced by Grade 's English ITV franchise company ATV at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire , and was shown around the world , including the United States , where it aired in syndication ( including the owned - and - operated stations of CBS ) , and Canada , where CBC Television aired the show . The 1970s was a time when many British comedies , including The Benny Hill Show and Monty Python 's Flying Circus were syndicated to the United States and worldwide . Many soaps and long - running series are also successfully syndicated around the globe .   The television show CSI earned $1.6 million per episode in its first cycle in cable syndication . There were many different versions of the show making it an international success . It was already popular in the U.S. , so becoming a success internationally as well as within the U.S. made syndication sensible . Whether a series is produced in the U.S. or not is based on the economic value and potential viability of its sales internationally with the possibility of syndication .   Economic factors that influence production outside the U.S. play a major role in deciding if a television show will be syndicated , internally and internationally . International syndication has sustained a growing of prosperity and monetary value amongst the distributors who sell to them . Due to a rise in competition , syndicators have upheld high standards for different countries to buy the rights to distribute shows . During the 1990s poor ratings were common amongst syndicated shows , but distributors still made it possible for international competition to happen and buy U.S. shows . Colombian , Brazilian , Mexican and Venezuelan telenovelas are programmed throughout the Portuguese and Spanish - speaking world , and in many parts of India , China and Europe , while Turkish television drama is broadcast in the Balkans , some other European countries , Western and Central Asia and North Africa .   U.S. - style syndication internationally ( edit )   Because of the structural differences discussed above , there are presently very few areas where a true U.S. - style syndication model operates , whereby programs are sold on a per - area basis ( within a single country ) to local or regional stations with differing ( or no ) network affiliations . Canada was historically one of the few exceptions . Until the mid-1990s , television stations in Canada , like those in the U.S. , were typically run as separate local operations , with a small number of moderately sized ownership groups such as Baton , CanWest , WIC , and CHUM . Those stations that were affiliated with a national network , i.e. CBC or CTV , did not always receive a full schedule of programming from that network .   At this time , it was not uncommon for U.S. syndicators to treat Canada as an extension of their domestic syndication operations , for both their first - run and off - network offerings . This is still the case for American radio programs ; Canadian radio networks are not assembled as rigidly into networks ( except for the CBC 's radio division ) . However , an alternate form of first - run syndication was performed by some domestic broadcasters : as the Canadian rights to U.S. primetime series were often acquired by individual station groups ( as opposed to full - fledged national networks ) , they would in turn resell local rights for those programs to stations in areas where they did not operate . A few of Canada 's independent stations , most notably CHCH - TV and CITY - TV , also resyndicated their own locally produced programs to other television stations . Unlike in the United States , however , few Canadian programs were ever created solely for syndication without officially belonging to at least one specific station or network ; those that did exist were intended primarily to be syndicated into the American system , and even those were typically distributed in Canada as `` network '' programs rather than being sold to individual stations .   Since the late 1990s , as most stations have been consolidated into national networks consisting almost entirely of owned - and - operated stations and with full - day network schedules , both types of syndication have largely disappeared from the Canadian broadcast landscape . Programs that are sold in syndication in the U.S. are now generally sold to Canadian media groups to air across all their properties , with per - market sales now being very rare . For example , American shows that air in syndication in the United States , such as Live with Kelly and Ryan or The Ellen DeGeneres Show , air in Canada as core parts of the CTV Television Network schedule . The Oprah Winfrey Show appears to have been the last significant holdout to this model , having aired primarily on CTV stations , but in some markets airing instead on a Global station , and even some CBC affiliates .   One syndication service remains in Canada , yes TV , which serves the few remaining independent stations in the country with mostly American programs ( Judge Judy , Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy ! are currently syndicated in Canada through yes TV ) . These independent stations can also secure deals with American syndicators ; CHCH , for example , has a direct deal with 20th Television to carry some of that company 's classic sitcoms , including those from the MTM Enterprises library .   Regional syndication ( edit )   There are three key reasons why a radio station will decide to pick up a syndicated show -- the program is unique and difficult to replicate content , has a decent ratings track record , and whether or not it has a celebrity host . New developing radio programs are generally able to claim one of these attributes , but not all three . Regional syndication attempts to replace these benchmark attributes with other benefits that are generally recognized by the industry as also being important . Given the financial downturn within the industry , the need for quality cost effective locally relevant programming is greater than ever before . Programs that offer regionally specific content while providing the economic benefits of syndication can be especially appealing to potential affiliates . Regional syndication can also be more attractive to area advertisers who share a common regional trading area versus assembling a radio network of stations that hopscotch across the United States .

Prize   The last remaining House Guest is set to receive a prize of $500,000 .   Main twists   This season 's main theme and twists centered on technology .  BB App Store  For the first three weeks , viewers were asked a series of questions about their opinions on the remaining House Guests . The House Guest who was named in the most overall answers was deemed the `` top trending '' House Guest of the week and earned a `` Power App '' , which would give them an advantage in the game , while the House Guest who was answered the least was deemed `` least trending '' was given a `` Crap App '' , which gave them a punishment . Once HouseGuests received an app , they were no longer eligible to receive one in the future .     Week   Top trending   Power App   Least trending   Crap App   Punishment     Name   Ability   Status       Sam   Bonus Life   To be used immediately after a HouseGuest is evicted from the house , this power will give that House Guest a chance to return to the game via a competition . This power must be used in the first three evictions , or else the fourth evicted House Guest will automatically be given the chance to return .   Used ( by default )   Faysal   Hamazon   The House Guest will routinely be given packages of ham , which they must consume on arrival . ( As Faysal is Muslim , a vegetarian ham substitute was used instead . )       Tyler   The Cloud   The House Guest has the power to make themselves immune from nomination during one Nomination or Veto Ceremony of their choice over the following eight weeks .   Not used   Rachel   Yell !   For 24 hours , an angry reviewer was unleashed into the house at random times to loudly give the House Guest feedback on their game .       Bayleigh   Identity Theft   The House Guest can secretly replace the HoH 's nominations with two of their own . This does not affect replacement nominations and can be used until eight players remain .   Not used   Haleigh   Read It !   Periodically throughout the week , the House Guest must wear a costume and read Hamlet in a Shakespearean accent . This punishment will continue until the entire play has been read .    H@cker competition  On Day 44 , following Rachel 's eviction , a new twist was unleashed on the HouseGuests called the `` H@cker Competition '' . It lets one HouseGuest hack the game for a week . After the nominations , all of the HouseGuests compete in a competition at the same time in different rooms , making the winner anonymous to the other HouseGuests . The winner of the competition is able to `` hack '' the game in three different ways . First , they can replace one of the Head of Household 's nominations and change it to someone of their choosing . Second , they get to select one of the three participants chosen for the Power of Veto competition . Finally , they can nullify one vote at the live eviction .

Controversies and criticisms   Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix received criticism after he was shown using an ice cream scooper on the genitals of his other HouseGuests . Mounduix later told fellow HouseGuest Kaycee Clark to open up her vagina , saying it `` feels good '' .   Viewers questioned Angela Rummans and Rachel Swindler after they were caught on the live feeds making racist remarks , referencing fellow HouseGuest , Bayleigh Dayton . Rummans called her tan `` ghetto '' , while Swindler compared her skin tone to Dayton 's , who is African American . CBS later released a statement and warned Rummans and Swindler with future consequences .   Since the start of the live feeds , Kaitlyn Herman has been criticized from viewers for her feelings and actions towards several men in the Big Brother House , while being in a 5 - year relationship outside of the house . In Week 3 , Herman 's then - boyfriend released a statement on Twitter , stating that he wanted to distance himself from the show and situation .   Kaitlyn Herman and Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix both came under fire after they used the n - word in separate occasions . Herman used the word as she was singing the lyrics of a Drake song . Mounduix used the word after fellow HouseGuest Bayleigh Dayton , who is African American , asked Mounduix if there is a `` difference between a midget and a dwarf '' . Offended , Mounduix said that the word `` midget '' is a derogatory term and then compared it to the n - word . Many came to the defense of the two , saying that they did n't use the word towards someone . Herman later apologized for using the word on an Instagram live stream .   During a live eviction episode , HouseGuest Brett Robinson called out Angela `` Rockstar '' Lantry in his eviction speech for `` strategic purposes '' . Lantry responded by confronting Robinson in his face claiming that it was her daughter 's birthday . Lantry later called Robinson a `` rich , snobby , white - privileged - ass dude '' . Later that night , Lantry confronted Robinson with pots and pans during which she exclaimed that Robinson has a `` micropenis '' . Upon confrontation , Lantry sat between Robinson 's legs whom repeatedly asked her to get off of him .   Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix was criticized by fans after he asked Rachel Swindler if she was transgender , stating that she has `` a big Adam 's apple . '' Mounduix proceeded to feel Swindler 's neck , but she told him to stop . Moments later , he began to touch Swindler 's neck again before being stopped by her .   Viewers perceived some of Bayleigh Dayton 's comments about Faysal Shafaat as being anti-Muslim . After Shafaat , a Muslim , complained about his in - house crush Haleigh Broucher talking about her past sexual experiences , Dayton claimed in private that Shafaat should `` go find a virgin '' and that he should `` go to Pakistan and ( get himself ) one '' because `` that 's what they do . '' Many viewers interpreted `` they '' as meaning Muslims .   During a conversation between Dayton and Lantry , Dayton claimed that Lantry was the only white person who she knew that did n't like white people . Dayton then said that Lantry dislikes `` normal white people '' more than she does . Days later , in a conversation with Haleigh Broucher , Dayton referred to her housemates as `` crazy - ass white people . '' Many viewers saw Dayton 's statements as racist .   Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix was criticized by both fans and his fellow housemates for making light of the # MeToo movement after making jokes at the movement 's expense .   Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix was once again involved in two separate sexual misconduct incidents in which he was accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault . While sleeping in the same bed , Mounduix was seen caressing Tyler Crispen 's arm , face , and chest , as well as kissing his armpit while Crispen was sleeping . The following morning Crispen stated to Kaycee Clark `` I 'm sleeping alone tonight -- JC is not sleeping with me '' . Mounduix explained his version by stating that he was `` comforting Crispen who was having nightmares '' . Later , Mounduix opened the toilet door while HouseGuest Haleigh Broucher was using it . Broucher repeatedly asked Mounduix to close the door whom refused and tied the door open . Broucher then yelled for assistance from production and later filed a complaint with executive producer Allison Grodner . The producers later released a statement saying that neither Crispen nor Broucher filed official complaints and that the two had expressed to them that they `` did not feel threatened or unsafe by Mounduix 's actions . ''   During a live eviction speech , HouseGuest Scottie Salton made sexual and vulgar comments towards HouseGuests Tyler Crispen and Angela Rummans . He hinted that Crispen received oral sex from Rummans , which got censored out by CBS .   Haleigh Broucher was criticized by both fans and her fellow houseguests after making a joke about disabled people . During a conversation with Tyler Crispen and Joseph `` JC '' Mounduix , Broucher opened a fortune cookie that read , `` Nothing can stop you from reaching your goals . '' After reading the quote , she responded by saying `` That is not true because if you are paralyzed , you can not reach anything . '' Crispen was quick to call her out , telling Broucher that it was `` the worst thing ( he had ) ever heard ( her ) say '' . Crispen then told Broucher that she needed `` to rephrase '' what she had just said , to which Mounduix added that he had seen disabled people achieve their goals .   On finale night , Swaggy C , proposed to contestant Bayleigh Dayton . This sparked controversy among rumours that she got pregnant while in the Big Brother House . They later confirmed in a video that while in the house , Bayleigh did get pregnant but she suffered a miscarriage .

Uncertain future   The American adaptation of Big Brother has aired on CBS since its inception on July 5 , 2000 with Julie Chen as host . Following two articles published by The New Yorker by Ronan Farrow in July and September 2018 where several women accused Chen 's husband Les Moonves of harassment , intimidation , and sexual misconduct , effective September 9 , 2018 , Moonves departed CBS Corporation as President , Chairman and CEO with Joseph Ianniello appointed as President and Acting CEO . In response to the claims against him , Moonves released a statement denying the allegations . After the first article was published , Chen released a statement on Twitter in July defending her husband .   While Chen was initially confirmed to return to the ninth season of her other CBS show The Talk , she was absent from the season premiere that aired on September 10 , 2018 . Chen issued a statement where she was taking a few days off , but would continue with Big Brother . Chen 's first television appearance since Moonves ' departure was the live eviction on September 13 , 2018 , where she closed out the episode with `` From outside the Big Brother house ... I 'm Julie Chen Moonves , good night . '' The new sign - off broke with an established pattern that Chen has used in the past on Big Brother and showcased her support for her husband , while it received a mix response from fans and viewers on Twitter . Chen subsequently announced her departure from The Talk in a pre-recorded segment that aired on the September 18 , 2018 episode where she stood outside the Big Brother house . Chen will continue to host Big Brother .   The twentieth season had been confirmed since August 10 , 2016 as part of a two - year renewal between CBS and Fly on the Wall Entertainment , in association with Endemol Shine North America . Celebrity Big Brother was renewed for a second season on May 12 , 2018 during CBS ' annual upfront for the 2018 -- 19 television season . Speculation on the status of the show intensified after the departure of Moonves from CBS , with fans of the show and former HouseGuests began spreading the hashtag # SaveBBUSA in an attempt to get the program renewed . Unnamed insiders close to the production of the show have cast doubt if Chen would return to host potential future installments if CBS renews the show . In an article from US Weekly , an insider noted that former HouseGuests Will Kirby , Ross Mathews , and Big Brother Canada host Arisa Cox have been mentioned as potential replacements in the event that Chen does not to return , while TMZ reported that Chen will continue with the show if the network decides to renew it .   However , despite the show 's uncertain future , CBS began accepting online applications for a twenty - first season on September 20 , 2018 .

Against the orders of Vince , who now leads The Right Arm resistance , the three leave their camp to rescue their immune friend Minho , who is being tortured by the organization WCKD in hopes of developing a cure for the virus . Heading for the `` Last City '' , where WCKD 's headquarters is located , the group is attacked by Cranks , humans infected with the Flare . However , they are saved by Jorge and Brenda , who join them .   The group makes it to the wall of the Last City , which protects the city from Cranks . Outside the wall , people are rallying in protest to be let into the city . When WCKD opens fire at the protesters , the group is captured by a contingent of masked men and are taken to a hideout . One of the masked men is revealed to be Gally , who has survived being killed by Minho at the end of The Maze Runner . Gally takes them to see Lawrence , a rebellion leader for those outside the walls , who grants them permission to enter the Last City through a secret entrance . Gally leads Thomas and Newt through to the city and , spotting Teresa , Gally tells Thomas that she can get them into WCKD headquarters . The three capture her and she agrees to help them .   Thomas , Newt , and Gally escort Teresa inside WCKD headquarters and toward the location of the Immunes . Gally looks after the Immune children and stays to find a serum that can treat the Flare , while Thomas , Newt , and Teresa go to find Minho . They are caught and chased by a vengeful Janson , who leads WCKD 's troops . Teresa lets them escape to find Minho , before rushing to do a blood test on Thomas ' blood , which she obtained when removing trackers from the Gladers .   Gally gets the serum and takes the Immune children outside to a bus where Brenda is waiting . While Gally makes his way back into WCKD headquarters to find Thomas , Brenda is forced to leave with the Immune children in a bus as WCKD forces close in on them . Thomas and Newt reunite with Minho in the medical wing . They are chased by Janson before escaping . Teresa discovers that Thomas ' blood can cure the Flare . She shares her discovery with WCKD 's leader Ava Paige , both agreeing that they must find Thomas . Brenda and the Immune children are cornered by WCKD authorities but are saved by Frypan . Meanwhile , Lawrence rallies his rebels outside the city before blowing a hole in the city wall , allowing his allies and the infected people to storm the city . Outside the headquarters , Gally finds Thomas , Minho , and Newt . Sending Minho and Gally ahead , Newt gives Thomas a necklace with a silver cylinder pendant before passing out . Teresa transmits her voice throughout the city , telling Thomas that his blood can save Newt if he will only return to WCKD . Newt , nearly completely subsumed by the Flare , regains consciousness and attacks Thomas , while begging Thomas to kill him . Left with no other option , Thomas kills Newt .   Thomas makes his way back to WCKD and confronts Ava , who stresses that WCKD 's intentions are good . However , she is killed by Janson , who is turning into a Crank . Janson knocks Thomas out and drags him to a lab where Teresa is ready to extract his blood . However , he reveals that he and WCKD are only truly interested in curing those whom they please , which results in Teresa turning on him . After a fight , Janson is killed , allowing Thomas and Teresa to escape to the rooftop where an aircraft piloted by Jorge and Vince is waiting . Thomas makes it aboard , but Teresa is killed when the headquarters comes apart after being hit by a building collapsing owing to the rebels ' attacks .   The group reunites with the rest of the Immunes and The Right Arm , escaping to a safe haven that was revealed by Ava , where the remaining population can live in safety . There , Thomas discovers that the pendant Newt gave to him had a note in it . Still traumatized by Teresa 's death , he reads the note , in which Newt tells him to look after himself and everyone , before thanking Thomas for being his friend .

Nowlin , who co-wrote the first and wrote the second film , would adapt Maze Runner : The Death Cure . On September 16 , 2015 , it was confirmed that Ball would return to direct the final film .   Filming ( edit )   Principal photography began on March 14 , 2016 , in Vancouver , British Columbia . Previously it was revealed at San Diego Comic - Con International that filming would begin in February 2016 .   On March 18 , 2016 , it was reported that actor Dylan O'Brien was injured on set and was hospitalized . James Dashner announced via Twitter that the production was postponed after the accident . It was said that the producers were `` looking to '' resume filming around mid-May . According to the Directors Guild of Canada 's production list , the film was scheduled to resume filming on May 9 , and complete principal photography on July 26 . However , on April 29 , 2016 , production was shut down indefinitely as O'Brien's injuries were more serious than previously thought .   Filming resumed on March 6 , 2017 in Cape Town , South Africa . In May 2017 , it was announced that Walton Goggins would play the part of Lawrence , described as `` an unusual and dangerous character who is part - revolutionary , part - anarchist , and a voice for the voiceless people . '' Principal photography wrapped on June 3 , 2017 .   Release ( edit )   It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on February 17 , 2017 . However , due to Dylan O'Brien's injuries , the studio said that it was unlikely that this date was going to be met . On May 27 , 2016 , 20th Century Fox rescheduled the film for January 12 , 2018 , allowing time for Dylan O'Brien to fully recover .   On April 22 , 2017 , the studio delayed the release date once again , to February 9 , 2018 , in order to allow more time for post-production ; months later , on August 25 , the studio moved the release forward two weeks . The film premiered on January 26 , 2018 in theatres and IMAX .   Reception ( edit )   Box Office ( edit )   As of February 28 , 2018 , Maze Runner : The Death Cure has grossed $56.6 million in the United States and Canada , and $216.1 million in other territories , for a worldwide total of $272.6 million , against a production budget of $62 million .   In the United States and Canada , The Death Cure was released alongside the wide expansion of Hostiles , and was expected to gross around $20 million from 3,786 theaters in its opening weekend . The film made $1.5 million from Thursday night previews , in between the $1.1 million made by the first film and $1.7 million by the second , and $8.4 million on its first day . It ended up opening to $24.2 million , down from the previous film but still finishing atop the box office . In its second weekend the film dropped 58 % to $10.2 million , finishing second behind Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle .   A week prior to its North American release , the film debuted in South Korea , Australia and Taiwan , grossing $15.1 million over its opening weekend . During the first two weeks of international release , the film dominated the international box office taking $62.6 and $35.2 million respectively , and outpacing the two previous films .   Critical response ( edit )   On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 43 % based on 140 reviews , and an average rating of 5.1 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` Maze Runner : The Death Cure may offer closure to fans of the franchise , but for anyone who has n't already been hooked , this bloated final installment is best left unseen . '' On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100 , based on 37 critics , indicating `` mixed or average reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` B + '' on an A+ to F scale .   References ( edit )    Jump up ^ `` MAZE RUNNER : THE DEATH CURE ( 2018 ) ( 12A ) '' .

It forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate , and its motion is right - lateral strike - slip ( horizontal ) . The fault divides into three segments , each with different characteristics and a different degree of earthquake risk , the most significant being the southern segment , which passes within about 35 miles ( 56 km ) of Los Angeles . The slip rate along the fault ranges from 20 to 35 mm ( 0.79 to 1.38 in ) / yr .   The fault was first identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley , who discovered the northern zone . It is often described as having been named after San Andreas Lake , a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates . However , according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908 , Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley . Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California .   In 1953 , geologist Thomas Dibblee astounded the scientific establishment with his conclusion that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault . A project called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) near Parkfield , Monterey County , is drilling into the fault to improve prediction and recording of future earthquakes .

This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County . It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland , runs just east of the Bodega Heads through Bodega Bay and back underwater , returning onshore at Fort Ross . ( In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant `` sister faults '' run more - or-less parallel , and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes . ) From Fort Ross , the northern segment continues overland , forming in part a linear valley through which the Gualala River flows . It goes back offshore at Point Arena . After that , it runs underwater along the coast until it nears Cape Mendocino , where it begins to bend to the west , terminating at the Mendocino Triple Junction .   Central ( edit )   The central segment of the San Andreas Fault runs in a northwestern direction from Parkfield to Hollister . While the southern section of the fault and the parts through Parkfield experience earthquakes , the rest of the central section of the fault exhibits a phenomenon called aseismic creep , where the fault slips continuously without causing earthquakes .   Southern ( edit )  See also : Elsinore Fault Zone , Imperial Fault , Laguna Salada Fault , and San Jacinto Fault Zone  The southern segment ( also known as the Mojave segment ) begins near Bombay Beach , California . Box Canyon , near the Salton Sea , contains upturned strata associated with that section of the fault . The fault then runs along the southern base of the San Bernardino Mountains , crosses through the Cajon Pass and continues northwest along the northern base of the San Gabriel Mountains . These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range . In Palmdale , a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the Antelope Valley Freeway . The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of Elizabeth Lake . As it passes the towns of Gorman , Tejon Pass and Frazier Park , the fault begins to bend northward , forming the `` Big Bend '' . This restraining bend is thought to be where the fault locks up in Southern California , with an earthquake - recurrence interval of roughly 140 -- 160 years . Northwest of Frazier Park , the fault runs through the Carrizo Plain , a long , treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible . The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain .   The southern segment , which stretches from Parkfield in Monterey County all the way to the Salton Sea , is capable of an 8.1 - magnitude earthquake . At its closest , this fault passes about 35 miles ( 56 km ) to the northeast of Los Angeles . Such a large earthquake on this southern segment would kill thousands of people in Los Angeles , San Bernardino , Riverside , and surrounding areas , and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage .

( December 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The Pacific Plate , to the west of the fault , is moving in a northwest direction while the North American Plate to the east is moving toward the southwest , but relatively southeast under the influence of plate tectonics . The rate of slippage averages about 33 to 37 millimeters ( 1.3 to 1.5 in ) a year across California .   The southwestward motion of the North American Plate towards the Pacific is creating compressional forces along the eastern side of the fault . The effect is expressed as the Coast Ranges . The northwest movement of the Pacific Plate is also creating significant compressional forces which are especially pronounced where the North American Plate has forced the San Andreas to jog westward . This has led to the formation of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California , and to a lesser but still significant extent , the Santa Cruz Mountains ( the location of the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 ) .   Studies of the relative motions of the Pacific and North American plates have shown that only about 75 percent of the motion can be accounted for in the movements of the San Andreas and its various branch faults . The rest of the motion has been found in an area east of the Sierra Nevada mountains called the Walker Lane or Eastern California Shear Zone . The reason for this is not clear . Several hypotheses have been offered and research is ongoing . One hypothesis -- which gained interest following the Landers earthquake in 1992 -- suggests the plate boundary may be shifting eastward away from the San Andreas towards Walker Lane .   Assuming the plate boundary does not change as hypothesized , projected motion indicates that the landmass west of the San Andreas Fault , including Los Angeles , will eventually slide past San Francisco , then continue northwestward toward the Aleutian Trench , over a period of perhaps twenty million years .   Formation ( edit )  Tectonic evolution of the San Andreas Fault .  The San Andreas began to form in the mid Cenozoic about 30 Mya ( million years ago ) . At this time , a spreading center between the Pacific Plate and the Farallon Plate ( which is now mostly subducted , with remnants including the Juan de Fuca Plate , Rivera Plate , Cocos Plate , and the Nazca Plate ) was beginning to reach the subduction zone off the western coast of North America . As the relative motion between the Pacific and North American Plates was different from the relative motion between the Farallon and North American Plates , the spreading ridge began to be `` subducted '' , creating a new relative motion and a new style of deformation along the plate boundaries . These geological features are what are chiefly seen along San Andreas Fault . It also includes a possible driver for the deformation of the Basin and Range , separation of the Baja California Peninsula , and rotation of the Transverse Range .   The main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years . The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well - Fenner - San Francisquito fault zone around 22 -- 13 Ma . This system added the San Gabriel Fault as a primary focus of movement between 10 -- 5 Ma . Currently , it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the Eastern California Shear Zone . This complicated evolution , especially along the southern segment , is mostly caused by either the `` Big Bend '' and / or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and it surrounding branches .   Study ( edit )   Early years ( edit )   The fault was first identified in Northern California by UC Berkeley geology professor Andrew Lawson in 1895 and named by him after the Laguna de San Andreas , a small lake which lies in a linear valley formed by the fault just south of San Francisco . Eleven years later , Lawson discovered that the San Andreas Fault stretched southward into southern California after reviewing the effects of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . Large - scale ( hundreds of miles ) lateral movement along the fault was first proposed in a 1953 paper by geologists Mason Hill and Thomas Dibblee . This idea , which was considered radical at the time , has since been vindicated by modern plate tectonics .   Current research ( edit )   Seismologists discovered that the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield in central California consistently produces a magnitude 6.0 earthquake approximately once every 22 years . Following recorded seismic events in 1857 , 1881 , 1901 , 1922 , 1934 , and 1966 , scientists predicted that another earthquake should occur in Parkfield in 1993 . It eventually occurred in 2004 . Due to the frequency of predictable activity , Parkfield has become one of the most important areas in the world for large earthquake research .   In 2004 , work began just north of Parkfield on the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) . The goal of SAFOD is to drill a hole nearly 3 kilometres ( 1.9 mi ) into the Earth 's crust and into the San Andreas Fault . An array of sensors will be installed to record earthquakes that happen near this area .   The San Andreas Fault System has been the subject of a flood of studies . In particular , scientific research performed during the last 23 years has given rise to about 3,400 publications .   The next `` Big one '' ( edit )  Radar generated 3 - D view of the San Andreas Fault , at Crystal Springs Reservoir near San Mateo , California .  A study published in 2006 in the journal Nature found that the San Andreas fault has reached a sufficient stress level for an earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale to occur . This study also found that the risk of a large earthquake may be increasing more rapidly than scientists had previously believed . Moreover , the risk is currently concentrated on the southern section of the fault , i.e. the region around Los Angeles , because massive earthquakes have occurred relatively recently on the central ( 1857 ) and northern ( 1906 ) segments of the fault , while the southern section has not seen any similar rupture for at least 300 years . According to this study , a massive earthquake on that southern section of the San Andreas fault would result in major damage to the Palm Springs - Indio metropolitan area and other cities in San Bernardino , Riverside and Imperial counties in California , and Mexicali Municipality in Baja California . It would be strongly felt ( and potentially cause significant damage ) throughout much of Southern California , including densely populated areas of Los Angeles County , Ventura County , Orange County , San Diego County , Ensenada Municipality and Tijuana Municipality , Baja California , San Luis Rio Colorado in Sonora and Yuma , Arizona . Older buildings would be especially prone to damage or collapse , as would buildings built on unconsolidated gravel or in coastal areas where water tables are high ( and thus subject to soil liquefaction ) . The paper concluded :   The information available suggests that the fault is ready for the next big earthquake but exactly when the triggering will happen and when the earthquake will occur we can not tell ( ... ) It could be tomorrow or it could be 10 years or more from now .   Nevertheless , in the ten years since that publication there has not been a substantial quake in the Los Angeles area , and two major reports issued by the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) have made variable predictions as to the risk of future seismic events . The ability to predict major earthquakes with sufficient precision to warrant increased precautions has remained elusive .   The U.S. Geological Survey most recent forecast , known as UCERF3 ( Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3 ) , released in November 2013 , estimated that an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 M or greater ( i.e. equal to or greater than the 1994 Northridge earthquake ) occurs about once every 6.7 years statewide . The same report also estimated there is a 7 % probability that an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or greater will occur in the next 30 years somewhere along the San Andreas Fault . A different USGS study in 2008 tried to assess the physical , social and economic consequences of a major earthquake in southern California . That study predicted that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas Fault could cause about 1,800 deaths and $213 billion in damage .   Cascadia connection ( edit )   A 2008 paper , studying past earthquakes along the Pacific coastal zone , found a correlation in time between seismic events on the northern San Andreas Fault and the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone ( which stretches from Vancouver Island to northern California ) . Scientists believe quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas within the past 3,000 years . The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time - correlated events . However the 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been the exception to this correlation because the plate movement was moved mostly from south to north and it was not preceded by a major quake in the Cascadia zone .   Earthquakes ( edit )  See also : List of earthquakes in California  The San Andreas Fault has had some notable earthquakes in historic times :    1857 Fort Tejon earthquake : About 350 kilometers ( 220 mi ) were ruptured in central and southern California . Though it is known as the Fort Tejon earthquake , the epicenter is thought to have been located far to the north , just south of Parkfield . Two deaths were reported . The magnitude was about 7.9 .   1906 San Francisco earthquake : About 430 kilometers ( 270 mi ) were ruptured in Northern California . The epicenter was near San Francisco . At least 3,000 people died in the earthquake and subsequent fires . The magnitude was estimated to be 7.8 .   1957 San Francisco earthquake : A magnitude 5.7 quake with an epicenter on the San Andreas fault in the ocean west of San Francisco and Daly City .   1989 Loma Prieta earthquake : About 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) were ruptured ( although the rupture did not reach the surface ) near Santa Cruz , California , causing 63 deaths and moderate damage in certain vulnerable locations in the San Francisco Bay Area . Moment magnitude was about 6.9 . This quake occurred on October 17 , 1989 , at approximately 5 : 04 PM PDT .   2004 Parkfield earthquake : On September 28 , 2004 at 10 : 15 a.m. PDT , a magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck the Parkfield area . It was felt across the state , including the San Francisco Bay Area .

The game originated in Canada in the 1930s , where it is more popular than field lacrosse and is the national summer sport . Box lacrosse is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each , and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered . The playing area is called a box , in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse . The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick to catch , carry , and pass the ball in an effort to score by shooting a solid rubber lacrosse ball into the opponent 's goal .   The highest levels of box lacrosse are the National Lacrosse League ( NLL ) ( professional ) , Box Lacrosse League ( semi-pro ) , Senior A divisions of the Canadian Lacrosse Association ( semi-pro ) , the Western Lacrosse Association ( semi-pro ) , and Major Series Lacrosse ( semi-pro ) .   While there are 59 total members of the Federation of International Lacrosse ( FIL ) , only fifteen have competed in international box lacrosse competition . Only Canada , the Iroquois Nationals and the United States have finished in the top three places at the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships .

Lacrosse is a traditional indigenous people 's game and was first encountered by Europeans when French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley witnessed the game in the 1630s . Lacrosse for centuries was seen as a key element of cultural identity and spiritual healing to Native Americans . It originated as a field game and was adopted first by Canadian , American , and English athletes as a field game , eventually settling on a 10 v 10 format .   Box lacrosse is a modern version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s . The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure , but its invention has been attributed to one Paddy Brennan , a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal , who , being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game , experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s .   Joseph Cattarinich and Leo Dandurand , owners of the National Hockey League 's Montreal Canadiens in the 1920s , led the participating ice hockey arena owners to introduce the new sport . In the 1930s , 6 v 6 indoor lacrosse came to be played in the summer in unused hockey rinks . Canadians adopted the new version of the sport quickly . Eventually , it became the more popular version of the sport in Canada , supplanting field lacrosse . The form was also adopted as the primary version of the game played on Native American reservations in the US and Canada by Iroquois and other Native peoples . It is the only sport in which the American indigenous people are sanctioned to compete internationally , participating as the Iroquois Nationals . However , many field lacrosse enthusiasts viewed the new version of the sport with negativity .   The first professional box lacrosse games were held in 1931 . That summer , the arena owners formed the International Lacrosse League , featuring four teams : the Montreal Canadiens , Montreal Maroons , Toronto Maple Leafs , and Cornwall Colts . The league lasted only two seasons . In the wake of the original International Lacrosse League opened the American Box Lacrosse League featuring six teams : two in New York City , and one each in Brooklyn , Toronto , Boston , and Baltimore . The league played to small crowds on outdoor fields such as Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park , before closing midway through its inaugural season . Lacrosse was officially declared Canada 's National Summer Sport with the passage of the National Sports Act ( Bill C - 212 ) on May 12 , 1994 .   The first box lacrosse match conducted in Australia came about as part of a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne . The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a lacrosse match as part of a multi sport carnival at the Plaza ( Wattle Path Palais ) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931 . After a lightning six - a-side ( outdoor ) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior , it was decided to play six - a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs , with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match . Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even been created in Australia , with P.J. Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of the rules of the game from the VLA Secretary . By 1933 , box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide , Brisbane , and Perth . This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada .   The Canadian Lacrosse Association began sponsoring box lacrosse . In 1932 , the Mann Cup , the most prestigious lacrosse trophy in Canada , was contended for under box lacrosse rules for the first time . Previously , the national senior men 's lacrosse championship , awarded since 1901 , was competed for under field lacrosse rules . The Mann Cup is an annual tournament that presents the champion of the Western Lacrosse Association and Major Series Lacrosse in a best of seven national championship . A few years later , in 1937 , the Minto Cup , began being awarded under box lacrosse rules to the junior men 's champions . Currently the Canadian Lacrosse Association oversees the Mann Cup , the Minto Cup , the Presidents Cup ( Senior B national championship ) the Founders Cup ( Junior B national championship ) all under box lacrosse rules .   Briefly in 1939 , a professional box lacrosse league started up in California , called the Pacific Coast Lacrosse Association . This four team league also folded shortly after opening . Professional box lacrosse did not return to the United States again until 1968 when the Portland Adanacs and Detroit Olympics franchises played in the National Lacrosse Association , a circuit that folded after one summer season seaso .  National Lacrosse League action during an All - Star Game in 2005  A new professional indoor lacrosse league was created in the 1970s with the formation of the original National Lacrosse League . This league opened in 1974 with teams in Montreal , Toronto , Rochester , Syracuse , Philadelphia , and Maryland . For the 1975 season , Rochester moved to Boston , Syracuse moved to Quebec City , and Toronto moved to Long Island . Thus , by its second year , the original NLL was playing in all major league arenas : the Colisée de Québec , the Montreal Forum , the Boston Garden , Nassau Coliseum , the Spectrum , and the Capital Centre . When the two wealthier ' 75 NLL franchises , Philadelphia and Maryland , finished out of the playoffs , and with Montreal losing access to the fabled Montreal Forum in the upcoming season due to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games , the league folded after two seasons due to financial uncertainty .   The rebirth of professional box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13 , 1986 , with the formation of the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League , which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz . The league originated with four teams : the Philadelphia Wings , New Jersey Saints , Washington Wave , and Baltimore Thunder , and unlike box lacrosse generally , was played during the winter . The league rebranded itself as the Major Indoor Lacrosse League ( MILL ) immediately after its inaugural season , and in 1998 renamed itself again , this time to the NLL . In 1998 , the NLL entered into the Canadian market for the first time with the Ontario Raiders . Although 5 of the league 's 9 teams are based in American cities , more than two - thirds of the players are Canadian .   Rules ( edit )   Players , equipment and officials ( edit )  Windsor Clippers ( OJBLL ) runner in 2014 .  During play , a team consists of six players : a goaltender and five `` runners '' . A runner is any non-goalkeeper position player , including forwards , transition players , and defenders . Runners usually specialize in one of these roles and substitute off the field when the ball moves from one end to the other . When the sport originated teams played with six runners . However , in 1953 the sixth runner , a position called rover , was eliminated . The goalkeeper can be replaced by another runner , often when a delayed penalty has been called on the other team or at the end of games by teams that are behind to help score goals .   A player 's lacrosse stick must be between 40 inches ( 1.0 m ) and 46 inches ( 1.2 m ) in length ( youth levels may use shorter sticks ) . In most box lacrosse leagues , the use of a traditional wooden stick is allowed . However , almost no lacrosse players use wooden sticks anymore , preferring aluminum or another metal , and a plastic head . In the NLL , wooden lacrosse sticks are not allowed . Besides a lacrosse stick , each player must also wear a certain amount of protective equipment , including a lacrosse helmet with facemask , lacrosse gloves , arm and shoulder pads , and back / kidney pads . Rib pads are optional in some leagues .   In some box leagues , especially the NLL , the five `` runners '' wear helmets specifically designed for box lacrosse . These helmets consist of a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse face mask attached instead of a hockey cage .   During a typical game the number of officials can range from one to three , depending on the league and level of play . In most games there are at least two referees : a lead official and a trail official . In NLL games there are three officials per game .  Goaltender ( edit ) See also : Goaltender ( box lacrosse ) St. Catharines Spartans ( OJBLL ) goalie in 2014 .  The goaltender 's responsibility is to prevent the opposition from scoring goals by directly defending the net . Box lacrosse goaltenders equipment includes upper body gear ( measuring no more than 3 inches ( 7.6 cm ) up and 5 inches ( 13 cm ) out off the shoulder -- much larger than similar gear for field lacrosse or ice hockey goaltenders ) , large shin guards that must measure no more than 11 inches ( 28 cm ) at the knee , 9 inches ( 23 cm ) at the top of the shin and 7 inches ( 18 cm ) at the ankle , and a field lacrosse helmet or ice hockey goalie mask .   The 9 feet ( 2.7 m ) to 9 feet 3 inches ( 2.82 m ) radius area surrounding the net is called the `` crease '' . Players except for the goaltender may not enter the crease while playing the ball . Punishments for crease infractions include a change of possession , resetting of the time - clock , or a possible two - minute penalty depending on the infraction . Opposing players may not make contact with the goaltender while he is in the crease . Once he leaves the crease , however , he loses all goaltender privileges .   Even as box lacrosse grows in the United States , the American goalkeeper is a rarity . The skills required to be a successful field lacrosse goaltender and a successful box lacrosse goaltender are very different and do not lend well to one another .  Defenders ( edit )  A defender is a player position whose primary responsibility is to prevent the opposing team from scoring . Unlike in field lacrosse where some defensive players carry longer sticks , all box lacrosse defenders play with a maximum 46 inches ( 1.2 m ) long stick . Defensive tactics include cross checking ( where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance ) , body checking ( where a player makes contact with the opposition player in order to slow him down ) , and stick checking ( where a player makes contact with the opposition player 's stick in order to knock the ball loose ) .  Transition ( edit )  A transition player is a player whose responsibility is primarily to play during defensive situations with an offensive mindset . The goal of this player is to create fastbreaks and scoring opportunities .  Forwards ( edit )  A forward is a player position on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive . Typically , a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other , and will primarily play on that side of the floor . Some players , known as creasemen , do not focus on one side or the other . These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender .   Playing area ( edit )  Detailed diagram illustrating the differences and similarities between Canadian Lacrosse Association and National Lacrosse League box lacrosse playing areas  The playing area of box lacrosse is typically an ice hockey rink during the summer months . The playing surface is usually the concrete floor underneath the melted ice . Generally the playing area is 180 feet ( 55 m ) to 200 feet ( 61 m ) in length and 80 feet ( 24 m ) to 90 feet ( 27 m ) in width . The NLL plays on artificial turf placed on top of the ice . Some leagues , and teams that have dedicated box lacrosse arenas ( such as the Iroquois ) , have outfitted their playing surface with artificial turf similar to the NLL .   Box lacrosse goal dimensions are traditionally 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) tall . In the NLL , the dimensions are slightly larger at 4 feet 9 inches ( 1.45 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) tall . These nets are significantly smaller than field lacrosse nets which measure 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) wide by 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) tall .   Duration and tie - breaking methods ( edit )   A traditional game played under the rules of the Canadian Lacrosse Association consists of three periods of 20 minutes each ( similar to ice hockey ) , with the teams changing ends each period . The NLL plays four 15 - minute quarters rather than three periods . If the game is tied at the end of regulation play , a 5 - minute overtime ( 15 in NLL ) can be played . Overtime may or may not be sudden victory , depending on the league .   Ball in and out of play ( edit )  Referee placing the ball while opponents line up for a face - off .  Each period , and after each goal scored , play is restarted with a face - off . If a ball travels over the boards and outside of the playing area , play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball .   During play , teams may substitute players in and out freely . Sometimes this is referred to as `` on the fly '' substitution . Substitution must occur within the designated exchange area in front of the players bench in order to be legal . The sport utilizes a shot clock and the attacking team must take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball . In addition , players must advance the ball from their own defensive end to the offensive half of the floor within 10 seconds ( 8 in NLL ) .   Penalties ( edit )   For most penalties , the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one less player for a short amount of time . Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed . The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the other team is on the power play .   A two - minute minor penalty is often called for lesser infractions such as slashing , tripping , elbowing , roughing , too many players , illegal equipment , holding , or interference . Five - minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent , as well as for fighting . Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires , or the opposition scores a goal ( or three goals for the instance of a major penalty ) .   At the officials ' discretion a ten - minute misconduct penalty may be assessed . These are served in full by the penalized player , but his team may immediately substitute another player on the playing area unless a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct ( a `` two - and - ten '' or `` five - and - ten '' ) . In that case , the team designates another player to serve the minor or major ; both players go to the penalty box , but only the designee may not be replaced , and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes . In addition , game misconducts are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent . A player who receives a game misconduct is ejected and may not return to play . Receiving two major penalties in a game will result in a game misconduct .  A fight during a lacrosse game between two players on the Toronto Rock and Calgary Roughnecks  A penalty shot , where a player from the non-offending team is given an attempt to score a goal without opposition from any defending players except the goaltender , may be awarded under certain circumstances . By rule , teams must have at least three runners in play . If a team commits a third penalty resulting in a `` three man down '' situation a penalty shot is awarded in favor of having the offending player serve in the penalty box . A penalty shot may also be awarded , at the referee 's discretion , if a defensive player causes a foul to prevent a goal ( by throwing his stick , holding , tripping , or by deliberately displacing the goal , or a defensive player intentionally falls and covers a ball in his own team 's crease ) . In the NLL , a penalty shot is awarded against any team taking a too - many - men penalty in the final two minutes of the game or overtime .  Fighting ( edit )  Similar to fighting in ice hockey , fighting is tolerated in professional box lacrosse . Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection , but incur a five - minute major penalty . In Canadian Lacrosse Association play , players are assessed a five - minute major penalty plus a game misconduct . Fighting in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions . In 1990 , when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league , fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable . Violators were ejected from the game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension .   International competition ( edit )   Box lacrosse is the most popular version of the sport in the Czech Republic . It is also played to a marginal degree in Australia , primarily by players who have played field lacrosse . Club level box lacrosse leagues in the United States have increased the number of players exposed to the sport , including the : Baltimore Indoor Lacrosse League , the Philadelphia Box Lacrosse Association , and the Metro Area Box Lacrosse League .   The first world championship of box lacrosse , `` The Nations in 1980 '' , was staged in several arenas in British Columbia , Canada in July 1980 involving teams representing the United States , Australia , Canada East , Canada West and the Iroquois Nationals . Canada West ( Coquitlam Adanacs ) defeated the Iroquois in the nationally televised world championship game from Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver . This was the first time in history that Indigenous peoples of the Americas people represented themselves in an athletic world championship competition .   The second international box lacrosse tournament was held in 2003 , with the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championships . The competitors were national teams from Australia , Canada , the Czech Republic , the Iroquois Nationals , Scotland , and the United States .   The 2015 WILC was hosted by the Onondaga Nation which marks the first time an international sporting event has been held on indigenous land . 13 teams competed in the championship : Australia , Canada , Czech Republic , England , Finland , Germany , Iroquois Nationals , Ireland , Israel , Serbia , Switzerland , Turkey , and the United States .   Canada , Iroquois Nationals and the United States have won gold , silver , and bronze respectively in each of the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships held . Canada has yet to lose an international game in box lacrosse .   Other international tournaments have been played . Annually , the European Lacrosse Federation holds the Aleš Hřebeský Memorial tournament in Prague . This is the largest European box lacrosse tournament . In 2002 and 2004 , the Heritage Cup was played between the United States and Canada featuring mostly players that were members of NLL teams .   Women ( edit )   Historically , box lacrosse has been exclusively a men 's sport . Women who played the sport of lacrosse typically played the women 's field lacrosse version . Recently , Ontario , Alberta , Nova Scotia and British Columbia have established girls ' and women 's box lacrosse leagues .   During the 2003 NLL season , goaltender Ginny Capicchioni appeared in two preseason and one regular season games to become the only woman to make an appearance in the NLL .

It 's a rougher adaptation of the original field versions of lacrosse with elements similar to hockey and basketball . It has the speed , agility , flexibilty , coordination and main aspect of scoring on a net from hockey , the offensive set up ( 2 - 2 - 1 ) `` house '' when attacking the other team 's goal , a shot clock of 30 seconds to shoot on the net , and regular setting of `` picks '' similar to basketball . Box lacrosse defenders are allowed to block attackers from getting near their goal by cross checking , a technique that is not allowed in field lacrosse .

       "  'document_text_clean': \"Three seconds rule - Wikipedia  Three seconds rule  Jump to : navigation , search Not to be confused with the Five - second rule of food hygiene , or the two - second rule regarding safe driving , both sometimes known as the three - second rule .  The three seconds rule ( also referred to as the three - second rule or three in the key , with often termed a lane violation ) requires that in basketball , a player shall not remain in the opponents ' restricted area for more than three consecutive seconds while their team is in control of a live ball in the frontcourt and the game clock is running .   The three - second rule was introduced in 1936 and was expressed as such : no offensive player with the ball could remain in the Key with or without the ball , for more than three seconds .   The three - second rule came about in part following a game at Madison Square Garden between the University of Kentucky ( UK ) and New York University ( NYU ) in 1935 , won by NYU 23 - 22 . The university of Kentucky team did not take their own referee , a common practice at the time , despite advice to the UK coach Adolph Rupp from Notre Dame coach George Keogan , who had lost to NYU the week prior and who warned Rupp of the discrepancies in officiating between the Midwest and the East . The game was rough . UK was unable to run its normal offense ( which consisted of using screens ) without being called for a foul . New York University 's Irving Terjesen and Irwin Klein combined to guard one of UK 's major players , Leroy Edwards , allowing him to score a mere 6 points ( the lowest output of his career ) . The New York Post reacted with alarm : `` The score says that NYU is the best college basketball team in the country and that the East still is supreme . But if Frank Lane , the referee from the Midwest , had worked the game , it 's safe to assume big Leroy Edwards would have been given a fantastic number of foul shots . Minor mayhem was committed on the person of Edwards by Terjesen and Klein . Something will have to be done or the game will become entirely too rough .

Their use has been extended to many other meanings , more or less analogous . Plus and minus are Latin terms meaning `` more '' and `` less '' , respectively .     Contents  ( hide )   1 History   2 Plus sign   3 Minus sign   4 Use in elementary education   5 Use as a qualifier   6 Uses in computing   7 Other uses   8 Character codes   8.1 Alternative plus sign     9 See also   10 References and footnotes      History ( edit )   Though the signs now seem as familiar as the alphabet or the Hindu - Arabic numerals , they are not of great antiquity . The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for addition , for example , resembled a pair of legs walking in the direction in which the text was written ( Egyptian could be written either from right to left or left to right ) , with the reverse sign indicating subtraction :                 or                 Nicole Oresme 's manuscripts from the 14th century show what may be one of the earliest uses of the plus sign `` + '' .   In Europe in the early 15th century the letters `` P '' and `` M '' were generally used . The symbols ( P with line p̄ for più , i.e. , plus , and M with line m̄ for meno , i.e. , minus ) appeared for the first time in Luca Pacioli 's mathematics compendium , Summa de arithmetica , geometria , proportioni et proportionalità , first printed and published in Venice in 1494 . The + is a simplification of the Latin `` et '' ( comparable to the ampersand & ) . The − may be derived from a tilde written over m when used to indicate subtraction ; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter m itself . In his 1489 treatise Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols − and + as minus and mer ( Modern German mehr ; `` more '' ) : `` was − ist , das ist minus , und das + ist das mer '' . They were n't used for addition and subtraction here , but to indicate surplus and deficit ; their first use in their modern sense appears in a book by Henricus Grammateus in 1518 .   Robert Recorde , the designer of the equals sign , introduced plus and minus to Britain in 1557 in The Whetstone of Witte : `` There be other 2 signes in often use of which the first is made thus + and betokeneth more : the other is thus made -- and betokeneth lesse . ''   Plus sign ( edit )  `` + '' redirects here . For other uses , see + ( disambiguation ) .  The plus sign ( + ) is a binary operator that indicates addition , as in 2 + 3 = 5 . It can also serve as a unary operator that leaves its operand unchanged ( + x means the same as x ) . This notation may be used when it is desired to emphasize the positiveness of a number , especially when contrasting with the negative ( + 5 versus − 5 ) .   The plus sign can also indicate many other operations , depending on the mathematical system under consideration . Many algebraic structures have some operation which is called , or is equivalent to , addition . It is conventional to use the plus sign to only denote commutative operations . Moreover , the symbolism has been extended to very different operations ; plus can also mean :    exclusive or ( usually written ⊕ ) : 1 + 1 = 0 , 1 + 0 = 1   logical disjunction ( usually written ∨ ) : 1 + 1 = 1 , 1 + 0 = 1    Minus sign ( edit )  `` − '' redirects here . It is not to be confused with Hyphen , Hyphen - minus , or Dash .  The minus sign ( − ) has three main uses in mathematics :    The subtraction operator : A binary operator to indicate the operation of subtraction , as in 5 − 3 = 2 . Subtraction is the inverse of addition .   Directly in front of a number ( numeric literal ) and when it is not a subtraction operator it means a negative number . For instance − 5 is negative 5 .   A unary operator that acts as an instruction to replace the operand by its additive inverse . For example , if x is 3 , then − x is − 3 , but if x is − 3 , then − x is 3 . Similarly , − ( − 2 ) is equal to 2 . The above is a special case of this .    All three uses can be referred to as `` minus '' in everyday speech . In most English - speaking countries , − 5 ( for example ) is normally pronounced `` minus five '' , but in modern US usage it is instead usually pronounced `` negative five '' ; here , `` minus '' may be used by speakers born before 1950 , and is still popular in some contexts , but `` negative '' is usually taught as the only correct reading . Further , some few textbooks in the United States encourage − x to be read as `` the opposite of x '' or `` the additive inverse of x '' to avoid giving the impression that − x is necessarily negative .   In some contexts , different glyphs are used for these meanings ; for instance in the computer language APL and the expression language used by Texas Instruments graphing calculators ( definitely at least the early models including the TI - 81 and TI - 82 ) a raised minus sign is used in negative numbers ( as in 2 − 5 shows 3 ) , but such usage is uncommon .   In mathematics and most programming languages , the rules for the order of operations mean that − 5 is equal to − 25 : Powers bind more strongly than the unary minus , which binds more strongly than multiplication or division . However , in some programming languages and Microsoft Excel in particular , unary operators bind strongest , so in those cases − 5 ^ 2 is 25 but 0 − 5 ^ 2 is − 25 .   Use in elementary education ( edit )   Some elementary teachers use raised plus and minus signs before numbers to show they are positive or negative numbers . For example , subtracting − 5 from 3 might be read as `` positive three take away negative 5 '' and be shown as    3 − 5 becomes 3 + 5 = 8 ,    or even as    3 − 5 becomes 3 + 5 = 8 .    Use as a qualifier ( edit )   In grading systems ( such as examination marks ) , the plus sign indicates a grade one level higher and the minus sign a grade lower . For example , B − ( `` B minus '' ) is one grade lower than B. Sometimes this is extended to two plus or minus signs ; for example A++ is two grades higher than A .   Positive and negative are sometimes abbreviated as + ve and − ve .   In mathematics the one - sided limit x → a means x approaches a from the right , and x → a means x approaches a from the left . For example , when calculating what x is when x approaches 0 , because x → + ∞ when x → 0 but x → − ∞ when x → 0 .   Blood types are often qualified with a plus or minus to indicate the presence or absence of the Rh factor ; for instance , A+ means A-type blood with the Rh factor present , while B − means B - type blood with the Rh factor absent .   In music , augmented chords are symbolized with a plus sign , although this practice is not universal as there are other methods for spelling those chords . For example , `` C + '' is read `` C augmented chord '' . Also used as superscript .   Uses in computing ( edit )   As well as the normal mathematical usage plus and minus may be used for a number of other purposes in computing .   Plus and minus signs are often used in tree view on a computer screen to show if a folder is collapsed or not .   In some programming languages , concatenation of strings is written `` a '' + `` b '' , and results in `` ab '' .   In most programming languages , subtraction and negation are indicated with the ASCII hyphen - minus character , - . In APL a raised minus sign ( Unicode U + 00AF ) is used to denote a negative number , as in _̄ 3 . While in J a negative number is denoted by an underscore , as in _5 .   In C and some other computer programming languages , two plus signs indicate the increment operator and two minus signs a decrement . For example , x++ means `` increment the value of x by one '' and x -- means `` decrement the value of x by one '' . By extension , `` + + '' is sometimes used in computing terminology to signify an improvement , as in the name of the language C++ .   In regular expressions , `` + '' is used to indicate `` 1 or more '' in a pattern to be matched . For example , `` x + '' means `` one or more of the letter x '' .   There is no concept of negative zero in mathematics , but in computing − 0 may have a separate representation from zero . In the IEEE floating - point standard , 1 / − 0 is negative infinity ( − ∞ ) whereas 1 / 0 is positive infinity ( ∞ ) .   Other uses ( edit )   In chemistry , the minus sign ( rather than an en dash ) is used for a single covalent bond between two atoms , as in the skeletal formula .   Subscripted plus and minus signs are used as diacritics in the International Phonetic Alphabet to indicate advanced or retracted articulations of speech sounds .   The minus sign is also used as tone letter in the orthographies of Dan , Krumen , Karaboro , Mwan , Wan , Yaouré , Wè , Nyabwa and Godié . The Unicode character used for the tone letter ( U + 02D7 ) is different from the mathematical minus sign .   In the algebraic notation used to record games of chess , the plus sign ( + ) is used to denote a move that puts the opponent into check . A double plus ( + + ) is sometimes used to denote double check . Combinations of the plus and minus signs are used to evaluate a move ( + / − , + / = , = / + , − / + ) .   Character codes ( edit )  Plus , minus , and hyphen - minus .

It is usually shorter in length than the plus sign and sometimes at a different height . It can be used as a substitute for the true minus sign when the character set is limited to ASCII . Most programming languages and other computer readable languages do this , since ASCII is generally available as a subset of most character encodings , while U + 2212 is a Unicode feature only .   There is a commercial minus sign ( ⁒ ) , which looks somewhat like an obelus , at U + 2052 ( HTML & # x2052 ;) .   The &plus ; entity is HTML 5 .  For detailed distinctions between minus signs and dashes , see Dash § Similar Unicode characters .  Alternative plus sign ( edit )  See also : Up tack  A Jewish tradition that dates from at least the 19th century is to write plus using a symbol like an inverted T . This practice was adopted into Israeli schools and is still commonplace today in elementary schools ( including secular schools ) but in fewer secondary schools . It is also used occasionally in books by religious authors , but most books for adults use the international symbol `` + '' . The reason for this practice is that it avoids the writing of a symbol `` + '' that looks like a Christian cross . Unicode has this symbol at position U + FB29 + HEBREW LETTER ALTERNATIVE PLUS SIGN .

And Bob 's your uncle is an expression of unknown origin , that means `` and there it is '' or `` and there you have it . '' It is commonly used in Great Britain and Commonwealth countries . Typically , someone says it to conclude a set of simple instructions or when a result is reached . The meaning is similar to that of the French expression `` et voilà ! ''   `` Bob 's your uncle '' is an exclamation that is used when `` everything is all right '' and the simple means of obtaining the successful result is explained . For example : `` left over right ; right over left , and Bob 's your uncle -- a reef knot . '' Sometimes the phrase is followed with `` and Nellie 's your aunt '' or `` and Fanny 's your aunt . '' It is sometimes elaborately phrased Robert is your mother 's brother or similar for comic effect .   Origin ( edit )   A.J. Langguth and others have suggested that the expression arose after Conservative Prime Minister Robert `` Bob '' Cecil appointed his nephew Arthur Balfour as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1887 , an act which was apparently both surprising and unpopular . Whatever other qualifications Balfour might have had , `` Bob 's your uncle '' was seen as the conclusive one . Regardless of the origin , the meaning has become acknowledging , announcing , or explaining a result or outcome that is achieved more easily than might be imagined .   It is suggested in Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts that Frederick Roberts , 1st Earl Roberts was known as Uncle Bobs and that the phrase referred to him .

It first aired on May 18 , 2000 , as the finale to the sixth season . It is normally transmitted as a whole episode in a one - hour slot , but when it is split for a half - hour slot the episodes are differentiated by having the title suffixed with Part One and Part Two . The episode was selected for Volume 4 of the `` Best of Friends '' DVD series , and when the series left the air in 2004 , several articles and viewer polls included this episode as one of the 10 best of the series ' 236 episodes .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Plot   1.1 Part One   1.2 Part Two     2 Production   3 Reception   3.1 Awards and nominations     4 References   5 External links      Plot ( edit )   Part one ( edit )   Ross is being questioned by his friends about his relationship with Elizabeth ( Alexandra Holden ) ; mainly asking if the relationship is going anywhere . Ross quickly claims he and Elizabeth are great together , and his friends are all wrong ... until he sees her having a water balloon fight with her buddies . Deciding she is too young , he breaks off the relationship . Afterward , Ross questions his decision , until Elizabeth confirms her immaturity by dropping water balloons on his head from her upstairs window .   Rachel takes Phoebe and Joey to a charity event helping children , including a silent auction . While Phoebe is obviously over-drinking ( Phoebe : `` The more I drink , the less there is for the kids to drink ! '' ) , Joey has bigger problems ; misunderstanding the silent auction process , Joey thought that bidders guessed an item 's worth , with the prize going to the person with the closest guess . ( Rachel : Why would a charity give away a free boat ? Joey : I do n't know ... charity ? ) Joey `` guesses '' $20,000 and `` wins '' a yacht . Rachel and Joey try to convince the next highest bidder to buy the boat , but in the process of persuading the man of the boat 's virtues , Joey changes his mind and wants it for himself , although he can barely afford it .   After weeks of preparation , Chandler is ready to propose to Monica . While at a restaurant , Chandler begins his proposal however before he can ask the question Monica 's ex-boyfriend Richard ( Tom Selleck ) walks in and the moment is lost . When the others come home from the charity event , they constantly ask to see Monica 's hand , thinking Chandler proposed already . Feeling that Monica will figure out that Chandler plans to propose ( Chandler : `` Who walks into a room and asks to see a person 's hands ? ! '' ) , Joey suggests that Chandler pretend he does n't care about marriage and never wants to get married . Meanwhile , Richard approaches Monica at work and declares his love for her .   Part two ( edit )   The episode began with Richard telling Monica that he 's never gotten over her and that he wants to marry and have children with her . Monica is left confused and when Chandler talks about how he hates marriage and ca n't see why anyone should get married she starts to feel unsure about their whole relationship . After Joey confirms to Monica that Chandler seemingly has no interest in getting married , Monica decides enough is enough and goes to meet Richard - she describes his apartment as `` a grown - up 's apartment '' and talks to him about the unfairness of the situation . Joey meanwhile tells Chandler how his plan has backfired on him and he is now in serious danger of losing Monica for good , and he leaves on a frantic search intending to propose when he finds her . After Monica leaves Richard 's apartment , Chandler comes and asks for Monica - he starts off by saying that Richard is a very bad man and he had his chances but he blew them . He also says that he and Monica are meant to be together and now Richard has blown Chandler 's chances , revealing he 'd intended to propose . Richard advises Chandler to go to Monica , warning that if he succeeds in winning her back , he must never let her go .   After searching all day , Chandler hurries back to his apartment and when he gets there , Joey meets him in the hall , claiming Monica has left him because of his commitment issues . When Chandler enters their apartment , afraid of Monica actually leaving , he discovers that it 's far from being abandoned , there are candles lit all over and Monica is kneeling to propose . In the midst of proposing to Chandler , she cries from sheer emotion , saying , `` There 's a reason why girls do n't do this ! '' Instead , Chandler gets on his knees and proposes to her and Monica says yes . They then open the door to Joey , Rachel , and Phoebe , who have been waiting to celebrate . At first , they hesitate , feeling Ross should be there to share the moment , then decide that after three marriages , Ross can afford to miss one engagement celebration . End credits play while Monica and Chandler dance to Eric Clapton 's `` Wonderful Tonight . ''   Production ( edit )   According to the producers ' DVD commentary for this episode , the original plot for Ross was to have Elizabeth announce that she was pregnant , ultimately resolving at the end of the following season when it would be revealed that Ross was not the father of the baby . This idea was ultimately rejected by the producers since it would be investing a lot of time in a secondary character without a payoff . It would have also have been difficult to use the cliffhanger for Rachel 's pregnancy .   Sources suggest that David Schwimmer was actually out of the country filming Band of Brothers when the final scenes of the episode were filmed , hence why Ross is not there when the friends hug Monica and Chandler on hearing their announcement .   The producers decided to end the episode on a romantic moment rather than the usual joke . They also took care over the script before approaching Selleck to return as Richard , as the actor would only return if it seemed feasible .   The episode very nearly served as the series finale , given that NBC and Warner Bros. were in negotiations over the show 's future up until four days before the episode aired . The series ' stars demanded $750,000 salary for each actor per episode and agreed to a contract for two additional seasons , an agreement that later stretched into a further two seasons at $1 million salary for each of the stars .   Reception ( edit )   Entertainment Weekly listed Chandler and Monica 's proposal scene in their `` 26 Great ' I Love You 's '' .

Air Date   Audition Venue   City   Audition Date     May 30 , 2016   Orpheum Theatre   Los Angeles , CA   February 27 , 2016     June 6 , 2016   Lou Conte Dance Studio   Chicago , IL   March 11 , 2016     June 13 , 2016   Broadway Dance Center   New York City   March 18 , 2016     During the audition round , the judges interviewed each auditioner , watched a brief audition and gave feedback , while the auditioner 's family sat at the side of the stage and often participated in the interviews . Offstage , Cat Deeley chatted with contestants and judges . Approximately 100 dancers were sent through to the Academy .   Dance Academy ( edit )   Dance Academy week was split among two episodes . The June 20 episode covered the first day of the Academy . The first task for the 10 all - stars was to watch solo dances by each of the competitors who were sent through from the auditions . From these , each all - star selected five dancers ( at least three from their own dance style ) , from the large number of auditioners , to join their `` team '' . If a dancer was selected by more than one all - star , he or she could choose which all - star 's team to join . Choreographer Warren Carlyle and the all - stars then taught the 50 remaining competitors a Broadway couples dance routine in 90 minutes , and dancers from each team were paired with dancers from another team . After all of the couples danced , each all - star was required to cut one dancer from his or her team , leaving a total of 40 contestants . Throughout the episode , Maddie Ziegler and Cat Deeley interviewed successful competitors .   The June 27 episode covered days two and three of Academy week . On day two , the all - stars each narrowed down their teams to three and then two dancers , based first on a hip - hop routine for pairs choreographed by Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo , and then on a contemporary routine , created by Travis Wall , danced simultaneously by the remaining three members of each team . On the last day , the last two dancers from each team danced a solo just for their own all - star . Each all - star then selected one finalist , making a total of 10 finalists that he or she will mentor through the finals round . The all - stars and their finalists are :       Contemporary     Kathryn McCormick : season 6 , 3rd place -- Tate   Robert Roldan : season 7 , 3rd place -- J.T.

The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti .   The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans .   An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Casting   2 Character history   2.1 Name     3 Death   4 Notes   5 References      Casting ( edit )   During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call .   They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer .   Character history ( edit )   The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 .   The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love .   In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college .   On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby , as seen in the season 4 finale `` The Leap '' , he is seen in front of the classroom of students , one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother . But in the first episode of season 5 , `` Definitions '' , it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom -- Economics instead of Architecture . At the same time in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy ( Rachel Bilson ) , whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate . They see Ted enter the room , but when he announces the subject , The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off . She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom .   Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time .   Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band .   In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar .   In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding .   The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after .   The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey .   In `` Bass Player Wanted '' , the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall , carrying his son Marvin , on her way to Farhampton Inn . On their way , it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band , that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception . But the band 's leader , Darren , forced her to quit . The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band . She ends up alone at the bar , and while practicing a speech to give Darren , Darren walks up to her furious the groom 's best man punched him for `` no reason . '' Amused by this , the Mother laughs , and Darren quits the band in anger .   In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door .   In `` Gary Blauman '' , Ted and the Mother are on their first date . Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish - Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner . On the way there , Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run - in with Louis . She says that she is in the `` weirdest place on earth '' right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating . Ted walks her back to her apartment . They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away . The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her . When the story is over , they say goodnight again . The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time , before deciding to carry on their date .   In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton .   Name ( edit )   The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy .   Death ( edit )  See also : Last Forever  In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' .   A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 .   Notes ( edit )    Jump up ^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that `` Pilot '' is set .

Note that the picture shows several stages of one and the same spermatozoon - only one penetrates the ovum Illustration depicting ovulation and fertilization .  Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century .   The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus .   In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro .

Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell , known as zygote . The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism .   Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane ( edit )   Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical elevation , termed the cone of attraction or reception cone . Once the spermatozoon has entered , the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane , the perivitelline membrane , which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa .   Sperm preparation ( edit )  Further information : Acrosome reaction  At the beginning of the process , the sperm undergoes a series of changes , as freshly ejaculated sperm is unable or poorly able to fertilize . The sperm must undergo capacitation in the female 's reproductive tract over several hours , which increases its motility and destabilizes its membrane , preparing it for the acrosome reaction , the enzymatic penetration of the egg 's tough membrane , the zona pellucida , which surrounds the oocyte .   Zona pellucida ( edit )   After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida , which is an extra-cellular matrix of glycoproteins . A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida . This binding triggers the acrosome to burst , releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida .   Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells . As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 % genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort . It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection .   Recent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process .  Cortical reaction ( edit )  Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs . Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida . This in turn causes the glyco - proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other -- i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f -- making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm . This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm . The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg .   Fusion ( edit )  Fertilization and implantation in humans .  After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg . The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body . The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material .   Cell membranes ( edit )   The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place .   Transformations ( edit )   In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes .   The oocyte completes its second meiotic division . This results in a mature ovum . The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process , to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization .   The sperm 's tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus . This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin . Still , a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring .   Replication ( edit )   The pronuclei migrate toward the center of the oocyte , rapidly replicating their DNA as they do so to prepare the zygote for its first mitotic division .   Mitosis ( edit )   Usually 23 chromosomes from spermatozoon and 23 chromosomes from egg cell fuse ( half of spermatozoons carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome ) . Their membranes dissolve , leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes . During this dissolution , a mitotic spindle forms between them . The spindle captures the chromosomes before they disperse in the egg cytoplasm . Upon subsequently undergoing mitosis ( which includes pulling of chromatids towards centrioles in anaphase ) the cell gathers genetic material from the male and female together . Thus , the first mitosis of the union of sperm and oocyte is the actual fusion of their chromosomes .   Each of the two daughter cells resulting from that mitosis has one replica of each chromatid that was replicated in the previous stage . Thus , they are genetically identical .   Fertilization age ( edit )   Fertilization is the event most commonly used to mark the zero point in descriptions of prenatal development of the embryo or fetus . The resultant age is known as fertilization age , fertilizational age , embryonic age , fetal age or ( intrauterine ) developmental ( IUD ) age .   Gestational age , in contrast , takes the beginning of the last menstrual period ( LMP ) as the zero point . By convention , gestational age is calculated by adding 14 days to fertilization age and vice versa . In fact , however , fertilization usually occurs within a day of ovulation , which , in turn , occurs on average 14.6 days after the beginning of the preceding menstruation ( LMP ) . There is also considerable variability in this interval , with a 95 % prediction interval of the ovulation of 9 to 20 days after menstruation even for an average woman who has a mean LMP - to - ovulation time of 14.6 . In a reference group representing all women , the 95 % prediction interval of the LMP - to - ovulation is 8.2 to 20.5 days .   The average time to birth has been estimated to be 268 days ( 38 weeks and two days ) from ovulation , with a standard deviation of 10 days or coefficient of variation of 3.7 % .   Fertilization age is sometimes used postnatally ( after birth ) as well to estimate various risk factors . For example , it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation .   Diseases ( edit )   Various disorders can arise from defects in the fertilization process .    Polyspermy results from multiple sperm fertilizing an egg .    However , some researchers have found that in rare pairs of fraternal twins , their origin might have been from the fertilization of one egg cell from the mother and eight sperm cells from the father . This possibility has been investigated by computer simulations of the fertilization process .

It was a late 16th - century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America . The colony was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh .   The colonists disappeared during the Anglo - Spanish War , three years after the last shipment of supplies from England . Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname `` The Lost Colony '' .

Sir Humphrey Gilbert 's half - brother Sir Walter Raleigh later gained his brother 's charter from the Queen and subsequently executed the details of the charter through his delegates Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville , Raleigh 's distant cousin .   Raleigh 's charter  A watercolor of the fort in Guyanailla Bay , which is likely similar to the fort constructed on Roanoke  On March 25 , 1584 , Queen Elizabeth I granted Raleigh a charter for the colonization of the area of North America . This charter specified that Raleigh needed to establish a colony in North America , or lose his right to colonization .   The Queen and Raleigh intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World . The queen 's charter said that Raleigh was supposed to `` discover , search , find out , and view such remote heathen and barbarous Lands , Countries , and territories ... to have , hold , occupy , and enjoy '' .   The queen 's charter also said that Raleigh was supposed to establish a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain . The purpose of these raids was to tell Spain that England was ready for war . The original charter basically told Raleigh to establish a military base to counteract the activities of the Spaniards . Raleigh himself never visited North America , although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to South America 's Orinoco River basin in search of the legendary golden city of El Dorado .   First Voyages to Roanoke Island   On April 27 , 1584 , Raleigh dispatched an expedition led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore the eastern coast of North America . They arrived on Roanoke Island on July 4 and soon established relations with the local natives , the Secotans and Croatans . Barlowe returned to England with two Croatans named Manteo and Wanchese , who were able to describe the politics and geography of the area to Raleigh . Based on the information given , Raleigh organized a second expedition , to be led by Sir Richard Grenville .  Sir Walter Raleigh  Grenville 's fleet departed Plymouth on April 9 , 1585 , with five main ships : Tiger ( Grenville 's ) , Roebuck , Red Lion , Elizabeth , and Dorothy . A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated Tiger from the rest of the fleet . The captains had a contingency plan if they were separated , which was to meet up again in Puerto Rico , and Tiger arrived in the `` Baye of Muskito '' ( Guayanilla Bay ) on May 11 .   While waiting for the other ships , Grenville established relations with the resident Spanish while simultaneously engaging in some privateering against them . He also built a fort . Elizabeth arrived soon after the fort 's construction . Grenville eventually tired of waiting for the remaining ships and departed on June 7 . The fort was abandoned , and its location remains unknown .   Tiger sailed through Ocracoke Inlet on June 26 , but it struck a shoal , ruining most of the food supplies . The expedition succeeded in repairing the ship and , in early July , reunited with Roebuck and Dorothy , which had arrived in the Outer Banks with Red Lion some weeks previous . Red Lion had dropped off its passengers and left for Newfoundland for privateering .   In the New World   During the initial exploration of the mainland coast and the native settlements , the Europeans blamed the natives of the village of Aquascogoc for stealing a silver cup . As retaliation , the settlers sacked and burned the village . English writer and courtier Richard Hakluyt 's contemporaneous reports also describe this incident . ( Hakluyt 's reports of the first voyage to Roanoke were compiled from accounts by various financial backers , including Sir Walter Raleigh . Hakluyt himself never traveled to the New World . )   Despite this incident and a lack of food , Grenville decided to leave Ralph Lane and 107 men to establish a colony at the north end of Roanoke Island , promising to return in April 1586 with more men and fresh supplies . The group disembarked on August 17 , 1585 , and built a small fort on the island . There are no surviving renderings of the Roanoke fort , but it was likely similar in structure to the one in Guayanilla Bay . Grenville in the Tiger on only his seventh day of sail captured ( after a three - day battle ) a rich Spanish galleon , Santa Maria de San Vicente off Bermuda which he took with him as a prize back to England .   As April 1586 passed , there was no sign of Grenville 's relief fleet . Meanwhile , in June , bad blood resulted from the destruction of the village , and this spurred an attack on the fort by the local Native Americans , which the colonists were able to repel . Soon after the attack , Sir Francis Drake was on his way home from a successful raid in the Caribbean , and he stopped at the colony and offered to take the colonists back to England . Several accepted , including metallurgist Joachim Gans . On this return voyage , the Roanoke colonists introduced tobacco , maize , and potatoes to England . The relief fleet arrived shortly after Drake 's departure with the colonists . Finding the colony abandoned , Grenville returned to England with the bulk of his force , leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh 's claim to Roanoke Island .   Lost Colony   In 1587 , Raleigh dispatched a new group of 115 colonists to establish a colony on Chesapeake Bay . They were led by John White , an artist and friend of Raleigh who had accompanied the previous expedition to Roanoke , and was appointed governor of the 1587 colony . White and Raleigh named 12 assistants to aid in the settlement . They were ordered to stop at Roanoke to pick up the small contingent left there by Grenville the previous year , but when they arrived on July 22 , 1587 , they found nothing except a skeleton that may have been the remains of one of the English garrison .  Baptism of Virginia Dare , the first English child born in North America . Lithograph , 1880  When they could find no one , the master pilot Simon Fernandez refused to let the colonists return to the ships , insisting that they establish the new colony on Roanoke . His motives remain unclear , however , and new evidence offered by author Brandon Fullam indicates not only that Fernandez had good reason for his actions , but that the decision to alter the Chesapeake Bay destination had already been agreed to prior to their arrival at Roanoke .   White re-established relations with the Croatan and other local tribes , but those with whom Lane had fought previously refused to meet with him . Shortly thereafter , colonist George Howe was killed by a native while searching alone for crabs in Albemarle Sound .   The colonists persuaded Governor White to return to England to explain the colony 's desperate situation and ask for help . Left behind were about 115 colonists -- the remaining men and women who had made the Atlantic crossing plus White 's newly born granddaughter Virginia Dare , the first English child born in the Americas .   White sailed for England in late 1587 , although crossing the Atlantic at that time of year was a considerable risk . Plans for a relief fleet were delayed first by the captain 's refusal to return during the winter , and then the attack on England of the Spanish Armada and the subsequent Anglo - Spanish War . Every able English ship joined the fight , leaving White without a means to return to Roanoke at the time . In the spring of 1588 , White managed to acquire two small vessels and sailed for Roanoke ; however , his attempt to return was thwarted when the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward - bound voyage ( in order to improve their profits ) . They themselves were captured and their cargo seized . With nothing left to deliver to the colonists , the ships returned to England .   Return to the Lost Colony  Further information : Watts ' West Indies and Virginia expedition The discovery of the word `` Croatoan '' carved onto a stockade board  Because of the continuing war with Spain , White was unable to mount another resupply attempt for an additional three years . He finally gained passage on a privateering expedition organised by John Watts and Walter Raleigh . They agreed to stop off at Roanoke on the way back after raiding the Spanish in the Caribbean . White landed on August 18 , 1590 , on his granddaughter 's third birthday , but found the settlement deserted . His men could not find any trace of the 90 men , 17 women , and 11 children , nor was there any sign of a struggle or battle .   The only clue was the word `` CROATOAN '' carved into a post of the fence around the village , and the letters C-R-O carved into a nearby tree . All the houses and fortifications had been dismantled , which meant that their departure had not been hurried . Before he had left the colony , White instructed the colonists that , if anything happened to them , they should carve a Maltese cross on a tree nearby , indicating that their absence had been forced . There was no cross , and White took this to mean that they had moved to Croatoan Island ( now known as Hatteras Island ) , but he was unable to conduct a search . A massive storm was forming and his men refused to go any farther ; the next day , they left .   Thomas Harriot   Born in 1560 , Thomas Harriot entered Raleigh 's employment in the early 1580s , after graduating from the University of Oxford . Harriot may have been among the men of Arthur Barlowe 's 1584 expedition of the colony . He trained the members of Raleigh 's first Roanoke expedition in navigational skills and eventually sailed to Roanoke with the second group of settlers , where his skills as a naturalist became particularly important along with those of painter and settlement leader John White .   Between their arrival in Roanoke in April 1585 and the July 1586 departure , Harriot and White both conducted detailed studies of the Roanoke area , with Harriot compiling his samples and notes into several notebooks that did not survive the colony 's disappearance . Harriot also wrote descriptions of the surrounding flora and fauna of the area , which survive in his work A Brief and True Report of the New Founde Land of Virginia , written as a report on the colony 's progress to the English government on the request of Raleigh . Viewed by modern historians as propaganda for the colony , this work has become vastly important to Roanoke 's history due to Harriot 's observations on wildlife as well as his depictions of Indian activities at the time of the colony 's disappearance .   Harriot reports that relations between the Roanoke Indians and the English settlers were mutually calm and prosperous , contradicting other historical evidence that catalogs the bloody struggles between the Roanoke Indians and both of Raleigh 's commanders , Sir Richard Grenville and his successor , Ralph Lane . Harriot recounts little to none of these accounts in his report to England and does not mention the disorderly state of the colony under either Grenville 's or Lane 's tenure , correctly assuming these facts would prevent Roanoke from gaining more settlers . Harriot 's text did not reach England , or the English press , until 1588 , by which time the fate of the `` Lost Colony '' was sealed in all but name .   Investigations into Roanoke  Reconstructed fortifications at Fort Raleigh National Historic Site  Twelve years went by before Raleigh decided to find out what happened to his colony . Led by Samuel Mace , this 1602 expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors ' wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering . However , Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip , and Mace 's ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic woods or plants such as sassafras that would generate a decent profit back in England . By the time they could turn their attention to the colonists , the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island . By this time , having been arrested for treason , Raleigh was unable to send any further missions .   There was one final expedition in 1603 led by Bartholomew Gilbert with the intention of finding Roanoke colonists . Their intended destination was Chesapeake Bay , but bad weather forced them to land in an unspecified location near there . The landing team , including Gilbert himself , was killed by a group of Native Americans for unknown reasons on July 29 . The remaining crew were forced to return to England empty - handed .   Meanwhile , the Spanish had different reasons for wanting to find the colony . Knowing of Raleigh 's plans to use Roanoke as a base for privateering , they were hoping to destroy it . Moreover , they had been getting mostly inaccurate reports of activities there , and they imagined the colony to be far more successful than it actually was .   In 1590 , they found the remnants of the colony purely by accident , but assumed it was only an outlying base of the main settlement , which they believed was in the Chesapeake Bay area ( John White 's intended location ) . But just as the Anglo - Spanish War prevented White from returning in a timely manner , Spanish authorities in the New World could not muster enough support back home for such a venture .   Reports of John Smith and William Strachey   Once the Jamestown settlement was established in 1607 , efforts were undertaken by the English to acquire information from the Powhatan tribe about Roanoke . The first definitive information concerning the fate of the Lost Colony came from Captain John Smith , leader of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609 . According to chronicler Samuel Purchas , Smith learned from Chief Powhatan that he had personally conducted the slaughter of the Roanoke colonists just prior to the arrival of the Jamestown settlers because they were living with the Chesepians , a tribe living in the eastern portion of the present - day South Hampton Roads sub-region who were related to the Pamlico tribe in Carolina and who refused to merge with the Powhatans . This shocking information was reported to England and by the spring of 1609 , King James and the Royal Council were convinced that Chief Powhatan was responsible for the slaughter of the Lost Colony .   The second source of Chief Powhatan 's involvement was William Strachey , Secretary of the Jamestown colony in 1610 -- 11 . Strachey 's The Historie of Travaile Into Virginia Britannia seemed to confirm Smith 's report and provided additional information : the colonists had been living peacefully among a group of natives beyond Powhatan 's domain for more than twenty years when they were massacred . Furthermore , Powhatan himself seemed to have directed the slaughter because of prophecies by his priests that he would be overthrown by people from that area , and he reportedly produced several English - made iron implements to back his claim .   The information from these two sources , John Smith and William Strachey , provides the basis for the traditional view that the Lost Colony was slaughtered by Chief Powhatan , and versions of the Powhatan - Lost Colony - slaughter scenario have persisted for more than 400 years . However , no bodies were found and no archaeological evidence has been found to support this claim .   Furthermore , recent re-examination of the Smith and Strachey sources advanced by author and researcher Brandon Fullam has suggested that the massacre described by Powhatan was actually of the 15 people left behind by the first Roanoke expedition , leaving the fate of the second colony still unknown .   Hypotheses about the disappearance     Integration with local tribes  The Francis Nelson ( or Zuniga ) map , c. 1607  As per Smith 's and Strachey 's reports , Dr. David Beers Quinn theorized that the colonists moved north to integrate with the Chesepians that Chief Powhatan claimed to have killed . To make the journey northward , Quinn believed that they used the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings . Naturally , if that were the mode of transportation , the colonists could have gone to live in other locations as well .   In her 2000 book Roanoke : Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony , historian Lee Miller postulated that some of the Lost Colony survivors sought shelter with the Chowanoke , who were attacked by another tribe , identified by the Jamestown Colony as the `` Mandoag '' ( an Algonquian name commonly given to enemy nations ) . The Mandoag are believed to be either the Tuscarora , an Iroquois - speaking tribe , or the Eno , also known as the Wainoke .   The so - called `` Zuniga Map '' ( named for Pedro de Zúñiga , the Spanish ambassador to England , who had secured a copy and passed it on to Philip III of Spain ) , drawn about 1607 by the Jamestown settler Francis Nelson , also gives credence to this claim . The map states `` four men clothed that came from roonock '' were living in an Iroquois site on the Neuse . William Strachey wrote that , at the Indian settlements of Peccarecanick and Ochanahoen , there were reportedly two - story houses with stone walls . The Indians supposedly had learned how to build them from the Roanoke settlers . In both cases , as stated above , it is equally possible that these were survivors of Chief Powhatan 's attack on the first Jamestown colonists .   There were also reported sightings of European captives at various Indian settlements during the same time period . Strachey wrote in 1612 that four English men , two boys and one girl had been sighted at the Eno settlement of Ritanoc , under the protection of a chief called Eyanoco . Strachey reported that the captives were forced to beat copper and that they had escaped the attack on the other colonists and fled up the Chaonoke river , the present - day Chowan River in Bertie County , North Carolina .   John Lawson wrote in his 1709 work A New Voyage to Carolina that the Croatans living on Hatteras Island used to live on Roanoke Island and claimed to have white ancestors :   A farther Confirmation of this we have from the Hatteras Indians , who either then lived on Ronoak - Island , or much frequented it . These tell us , that several of their Ancestors were white People , and could talk in a Book , as we do ; the Truth of which is confirm 'd by gray Eyes being found frequently amongst these Indians , and no others . They value themselves extremely for their Affinity to the English , and are ready to do them all friendly Offices . It is probable , that this Settlement miscarry 'd for want of timely Supplies from England ; or thro ' the Treachery of the Natives , for we may reasonably suppose that the English were forced to cohabit with them , for Relief and Conversation ; and that in process of Time , they conform 'd themselves to the Manners of their Indian Relations .   From the early 17th century to the middle 18th century , European colonists reported encounters with gray - eyed American Indians who claimed descent from the colonists ( although at least one , a story of a Welsh priest who met a Doeg warrior who spoke the Welsh language , is likely to be a hoax ) . Records from French Huguenots who settled along the Tar River in 1696 tell of meeting Tuscaroras with blond hair and blue eyes not long after their arrival . As Jamestown was the nearest English settlement , and they had no record of being attacked by Tuscarora , the likelihood that the origin of those fair - skinned natives was the Lost Colony is high .   Fred Willard and Phillip MacMullan believe that the colonists along with the Croatans relocated to villages along the Alligator River in an area known as `` Beechland '' , slightly inland from Roanoke Island . Archeological remains of settlements have been discovered in the area , including coffins with Christian markings on them where there had been no previous record of a grave site , but their hypothesis is mostly based on oral histories and also lacks any definitive evidence .   In the late 1880s , North Carolina state legislator Hamilton McMillan discovered that his `` redbones '' ( those of Indian blood ) neighbors in Robeson County claimed to have been descended from the Roanoke settlers . He also noticed that many of the words in their language had striking similarities to obsolete English words . Furthermore , many of the family names were identical to those listed in Hakluyt 's account of the colony . Thus on February 10 , 1885 , convinced that these were the descendants of the Lost Colony , he helped to pass the `` Croatan bill '' , that officially designated the population around Robeson county as Croatan . Two days later on February 12 , 1885 , the Fayetteville Observer published an article regarding the Robeson people 's origins . This article states :   They say that their traditions say that the people we call the Croatan Indians ( though they do not recognize that name as that of a tribe , but only a village , and that they were Tuscaroras ) , were always friendly to the whites ; and finding them destitute and despairing of ever receiving aid from England , persuaded them to leave ( Roanoke Island ) , and go to the mainland ... They gradually drifted away from their original seats , and at length settled in Robeson , about the center of the county ...   However , the case was far from settled . A similar legend claims that the now extinct Saponi of Person County , North Carolina , are descended from the English colonists of Roanoke Island . However , no documented evidence exists to link the Saponi to the Roanoke colonists .   Other tribes claiming partial descent from surviving Roanoke colonists include the Catawba ( who absorbed the Shakori and Eno people ) , and the Coree and the people who call themselves the Lumbee . Samuel A'Court Ashe was convinced that the colonists had relocated westward to the banks of the Chowan River in Bertie County , and Conway Whittle Sams claimed that after being attacked by Wanchese and Powhatan , the colonists scattered to multiple locations : the Chowan River , and south to the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers .   Other theories  Spanish  Another theory is that the Spanish destroyed the colony . Earlier in the century , the Spanish did destroy evidence of the French colony of Fort Charles in coastal South Carolina and then massacred the inhabitants of Fort Caroline , a French colony near present - day Jacksonville , Florida . However , a Spanish attack is unlikely , as the Spanish were still looking for the location of England 's failed colony as late as 1600 , ten years after White discovered that the colony was missing .  Dare stones Main article : Dare Stones  From 1937 to 1941 , a series of inscribed stones were discovered that were claimed to have been written by Eleanor Dare , mother of Virginia Dare . They told of the travelings of the colonists and their ultimate deaths . Most historians believe that they are a fraud , but there are some today who still believe at least one of the stones to be genuine .  Virginia Pars map  In May 2011 , Brent Lane of the First Colony Foundation was studying the Virginia Pars Map , which was made by John White during his 1585 visit to Roanoke Island , and noticed two patches where the map had been corrected . The patches are made of paper contemporaneous with that of the map . Lane asked researchers at the British Museum in London , where the map has been kept since 1866 , what might be under the patches , sparking a research investigation . On May 3 , 2012 , at Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , members of the Foundation and representatives of the museum announced the discovery of `` a large , square - shaped symbol with oddly shaped corners . '' This symbol , presumed to represent a fort , is visible when the map is viewed on a light box . Some scholars speculate that the colonists relocated to that location , on what is now called Salmon Creek in the Bertie County community of Merry Hill . The Scotch Hall Preserve golf course community was planned on the site , but it has not been fully developed .   The discovery of new information on the map led to more study of artifacts previously found , as well as additional digs in 2012 and 2014 .   Archaeological evidence   In 1993 , Hurricane Emily caused numerous relics to appear , and David Phelps of East Carolina University later began digging in the area and found evidence the settlers lived with the native people .   In 1998 , East Carolina University organized `` The Croatoan Project '' , an archaeological investigation into the events at Roanoke . The excavation team sent to Hatteras Island uncovered what they believed to be a 10 karat ( 42 % ) gold 16th - century English signet ring , gun flints , and two copper farthings ( produced sometime in the 1670s ) at the site of the ancient Croatan capital , 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the old Roanoke Colony . Genealogists were able to trace the lion crest on the signet ring to the Kendall coat of arms , and concluded that the ring most likely belonged to one Master Kendall who is recorded as having lived in the Roanoke Colony from 1585 to 1586 . If this is the case , the ring represents the first material connection between the Roanoke colonists and the Native Americans on Hatteras Island . However , archaeologist David Phelps did not have the ring tested , and Charles Ewen , who continued Phelps ' work after Phelps retired , had the ring tested and found the ring was brass . Ewen announced his findings in April 2017 . Mark Horton of the University of Bristol said he was not convinced that this news proved the ring did not date to the 16th century .   It is also believed that the reason for the extreme deficiency in archaeological evidence is due to shoreline erosion . Since all that was found was a rustic looking fort on the north shore , and this location is well - documented and backed up , it is believed that the settlement must have been nearby . The northern shore , between 1851 and 1970 , lost 928 feet ( 283 m ) because of erosion . If in the years leading up to and following the brief life of the settlement at Roanoke , shoreline erosion was following the same trend , it is likely the site of the dwellings is underwater , along with any artifacts or signs of life . Archaeological investigations continue to find tantalizing clues and funding is being sought to continue recent excavations .   Climate factors   In 1998 , a team led by climatologist David W. Stahle , of the University of Arkansas and archaeologist Dennis B. Blanton of the College of William and Mary used tree ring cores from 800 - year - old bald cypresses taken from the Roanoke Island area of North Carolina and the Jamestown area of Virginia to reconstruct precipitation and temperature chronologies .   The researchers concluded that the settlers of the Lost Colony landed at Roanoke Island in the summer of the worst growing - season drought in 800 years . `` This drought persisted for 3 years , from 1587 to 1589 , and is the driest 3 - year episode in the entire 800 - year reconstruction , '' the team reported in the journal Science . A map shows that `` the Lost Colony drought affected the entire southeastern United States but was particularly severe in the Tidewater region near Roanoke ( Island ) . '' The authors suggested that the Croatan who were shot and killed by the colonists may have been scavenging the abandoned village for food as a result of the drought .   Lost Colony of Roanoke DNA Project   The Lost Colony of Roanoke DNA Project was founded in 2007 by a group led by Roberta Estes , who owns a private DNA - testing company , in order to solve the mystery of the Lost Colony using historical records , migration patterns , oral histories and DNA testing . The project used Y chromosome , Mitochondrial DNA and Autosomal DNA . As of 2016 , they have not yet been able to positively identify any descendants of the colony .

West Africa is the portion roughly west of 10 ° east longitude , excluding Northern Africa and the Maghreb . West Africa contains large portions of the Sahara Desert and the Adamawa Mountains .   East Africa stretches from the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa to Mozambique , including Madagascar   Central Africa is the large mass at the center of Africa which either does not fall squarely into any other region or only partially does so .   Southern Africa consists of the portion generally south of - 10 ° latitude and the great rainforests of Congo .    This approach is taken , for example , in the United Nations geoscheme for Africa and the regions of the African Union .   Physiographic approach ( edit )  Satellite image of Africa , showing the ecological break that defines the sub-Saharan area  Another common approach divides Africa by using features such as landforms , climatic regions , or vegetation types :    Nile Valley   Nile Delta   Atlas Mountains   Nubia ( Lower Nubia )   The Sahara Desert is the massive but largely empty region in North Africa that contains the world 's largest hot deserts   The Maghreb is a region of northwest Africa encompassing the coastlands and Atlas Mountains of Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia .   The Sahel region covers a belt of grasslands south of the Sahara stretching from Senegal to Sudan .   The Sudan region lies just below the Sahel but is slightly more humid and arable .   Sudanian Savanna   The Horn of Africa is a peninsula in East Africa that juts for hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea , and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden . It encompasses Ethiopia , Eritrea , Somalia and Djibouti .   Ethiopian Highlands ( Roof of Africa )   Sub-Saharan Africa is the area of the African continent which lies south of the Sahara .   The Guinea region is distinguished from the neighboring Sudan region by its rainforests and runs along the Atlantic coast from Guinea to Nigeria .   Sudan ( region )   Negroland   Rhodesia ( region ) ( Northern Rhodesia , Southern Rhodesia )   Mayombe   The Congo Basin is the rainforest region   The Chad Basin The Chad Basin is the largest endorheic drainage basin in Africa , centered on Lake Chad .   East African Rift . The region contains Tanzania , Kenya , Uganda .   Eastern Rift mountains   Rift Valley Lakes   African Great Lakes   Swahili Coast   Pepper Coast   Gold Coast   Slave Coast   Ivory Coast   Barbary Coast   Mittelafrika   Igboland ( Mbaise )   Maputaland    Linguistic approach ( edit )  Map showing the traditional language families represented in Africa : Afroasiatic ( Semitic - Hamitic ) Austronesian ( Malay - Polynesian ) Indo - European Khoisan Niger - Congo : Bantu Central and Eastern Sudanese Central Bantoid Eastern Bantoid Guinean Mande Western Bantoid Nilo - Saharan : Kanuri Nilotic Songhai Main article : Languages of Africa  By official language ( edit )  Official languages in Africa    Afrikaans   Portuguese     Arabic   Spanish     English   Swahili     French   other languages      Anglophone Africa includes five countries in West Africa ( The Gambia , Sierra Leone , Liberia , Ghana , and the most populous African country Nigeria , as well as a part of Cameroon ) that are separated by Francophone countries , South Sudan , and a large continuous area in Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes .   Arabophone Africa includes the four most populous Arabic - speaking countries ( Egypt , Sudan , Morocco , Algeria ) as well as Tunisia , Mauritania and Chad , and includes a majority of both the population and the area of the Arabic - speaking countries . French has also kept a strong role in the Maghreb countries , though this has receded somewhat with official Arabization .   Francophone Africa is a continuous area in West Africa and Central Africa , plus Madagascar and Djibouti .   Lusophone Africa consists of the widely separated countries of Cabo Verde , Guinea - Bissau , Sao Tome and Principe , Angola , and Mozambique .   Equatorial Guinea is the only African country where the Spanish language is official , though French and more recently Portuguese have also been added as official languages .   Swahili is widely used as an inter language in East Africa ; its use for official and educational functions is greatest in Tanzania .   Ethiopia and Somalia use the Afro - Asiatic Amharic and Somali languages , respectively , as their official languages , although Arabic also serves as a secondary language in Somalia . Eritrea and parts of Ethiopia use the Tigrinya language and Arabic language as working languages .    By indigenous language family ( edit )    Niger -- Congo languages and Nilo - Saharan languages are spoken in most of Sub-Saharan Africa . Nilo - Saharan occupies a smaller area but is highly diverse , and may be related as a parent or sibling of Niger -- Congo .   Afro - Asiatic languages are spoken in North Africa , the Horn of Africa , as well as parts of the Sahel .   Khoisan languages are spoken in desert areas of Southern Africa , but were formerly spoken over a larger area , and are thought to include two small languages ( Hadza and Sandawe ) in the African Great Lakes .   Austronesian languages originating from Southeast Asia are spoken in Madagascar .    Investment approach ( edit )  Investment divisions of Africa . Source : RisCura  A slightly less common , but equally important method of division of the continent is by investment factors . For the purposes of investing , Africa is not a single destination with a single set of standardized risk factors and homogeneous potential for reward . Although some high - level similarities are evident , digging into the specifics of certain regions and countries shows that Africa comprises a range of distinct investment destinations , each with its own attractions , flaws , cultural differences and business practices .   The investment approach was first developed by global , independent financial analytics provider and investment consultant , RisCura .    Maghreb region   Otherwise known as the western portion of Northern Africa , these countries form the Arab Maghreb Union , established in 1989 . The region was established with the goal of functioning as a unified political and economic grouping . Political unrest in the region has stunted progress since its inception but hope still remains that the Union will fulfill its purpose in years to come . Algeria , Libya , Mauritania , Morocco and Tunisia are included in this region .     Egypt and Sudan   Previously united under British rule , these countries still share strong ties , as well as one significant commonality -- the trade facilitation through transport on the Nile River . As Egypt does not fall within the Arab Maghreb Union , it is separated from the rest of North Africa . However , Egypt 's strong economic and cultural ties with the Middle East bring natural trading partners , and it is often seen grouped with the Middle East for investment purposes .     Francophone West Africa   This is a commonly recognized region on the continent , and typically includes Mauritania . However , Mauritania is sometimes allocated to the Maghreb region as it is found to have closer ties to the North African countries . These French - speaking countries share more than just a language . Due to their common history as French colonies , they also share similar legal and socio - political systems . The countries in this group are Benin , Burkina Faso , Cape Verde , Côte d'Ivoire , Guinea , Mali , Niger , São Tomé and Príncipe , Senegal and Togo .     Nigeria   On its own , Nigeria is the size of the entire Maghreb region on an aggregated - GDP basis . While Nigeria is traditionally grouped with the rest of West Africa , its reliance on the rest of the region is less pronounced , likely as a result of its massive standalone GDP , its access to international markets via its six large ports , and its population of over 170 million people .     East Africa   This is a combination of the East African Community ( Kenya , Tanzania , Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) , the LAPSSET corridor ( Kenya , South Sudan and Ethiopia ) as well as Djibouti , a crucial link to the Indian Ocean for Ethiopia and South Sudan . Kenya has traditionally headlined this region through consistently generating the largest GDP and acts as the primary route to international trade through the Mombasa port .     Central Africa   This market is the same as that defined by the African Development Bank with the exception of Madagascar , which here is classified as Southern Africa ( ex-SA ) . On a GDP basis ( USD ) and by population , the Central Africa region is on par with the Francophone West African region . Countries included here are Cameroon , Central African Republic , Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo , as well as Equatorial Guinea and Gabon .     Southern Africa excluding South Africa ( ex-SA )   This incorporates countries south of central and eastern Africa , and north of the South African border . The region has support from the most developed economy on the continent from the south , and access to capital coming out of South Africa as large companies look to expand into the rest of the continent . The group comprises Angola ( which offers substantial oil resources ) , Botswana , Comoros , Madagascar , Malawi , Mauritius , Mozambique , Namibia , Reunion , Zambia ( substantial supply of copper ) and Zimbabwe .     South Africa   Like Nigeria , South Africa is a large African economy on a standalone basis . Due to the developed nature of South Africa relative to the rest of the continent , it has not been included in the Southern African region . South Africa boasts the largest GDP per capita of all the regions ( double that of Nigeria ) and is the most advanced investment destination on the continent . The South African market includes Lesotho and Swaziland due to their reliance and proximity to SA . The Swazi lilangeni is pegged to the South African rand , which is also accepted as currency within the country .     Other West Africa   This region includes Ghana , Liberia , Sierra Leone , Guinea - Bissau and The Gambia .

She was trained at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris and has appeared in such films as Loup ( 2009 ) , Sleepless Night ( 2011 ) and Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) . She plays the role of Mantis in the film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Early life   2 Career   3 Filmography   4 See also   5 References   6 External links      Early life ( edit )   Pom Klementieff was born in Quebec City , Quebec , Canada , to a Korean mother and French - Russian father , who was working there as a consul with the French government . She had a brother who committed suicide . Her parents chose the name `` Pom '' because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both `` spring '' ( 봄 ) and `` tiger '' ( 범 ) . Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family traveled extensively due to her father 's job , and she lived in Japan and the Ivory Coast before settling in France . Klementieff later said that travelling at an early age gave her a `` gypsy soul '' .   Klementieff 's father died of cancer when she was 5 , and her mother was schizophrenic and unable to care for children , so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt . Her uncle , whom she described as `` like my second father '' , died on her 18th birthday . Klementieff briefly attended law school after her uncle 's death to appease her aunt , but did not find the career path appealing . She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France . She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris . A few months into her education , she won a theater competition that awarded her free classes for two years with the school 's top teachers .   Career ( edit )  Klementieff in 2018  Klementieff 's first professional acting job was the French independent film Après lui ( 2007 ) , portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve . Filming for her scenes took three days . During one scene , Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself , and director Gaël Morel kept that shot in the final film . Her first leading role was in Loup ( 2009 ) , a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains . During filming , Klementieff stayed in a camp , hours from the nearest village , where temperatures dropped well below zero . During filming she befriended nomads who lived there , worked with real wolves , rode reindeer , and swam with a horse in a lake .   Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee 's Oldboy ( 2013 ) , a remake of the South Korean film of the same name . She portrayed Haeng - Bok , the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley . A fan of the original film , Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee , a producer with the remake , and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts . After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition , Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make - up , like her character in the film . She contributed some of her own clothes to the character 's wardrobe , and trained three hours a day for two months for an on - screen fight with star Josh Brolin . Klementieff came up with the name Haeng - Bok , Korean for `` happiness '' , herself after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character .   Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions . She continued taekwondo after the film , and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014 . Her next acting role was the film Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) , in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film , and due to the movie 's low budget , she had to do her own make - up and chose her own wardrobe . It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role , to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced . She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe with her role as Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) .

After several suggestions of what to call their snowman ( including `` Oatmeal '' and `` Christopher Columbus '' ) , Karen decides to name him `` Frosty . '' Later , the children acquire a top hat discarded by inept magician Professor Hinkle . Karen places the hat on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman comes to life ( and always says `` Happy Birthday ! '' in response ) . When Hinkle learns of the magic power his hat actually possesses , he takes it back and departs , pretending that he did not see Frosty come to life . However , the professor 's pet rabbit , Hocus Pocus , returns the hat to Frosty and the children .   Frosty soon senses the temperature is rising and worries about melting away . The children suggest putting him on the next train to the North Pole , where he will never melt , and they all parade into the city on the way to the train station , where Frosty has his confrontation with the traffic cop mentioned in the song 's lyrics . When Karen explains that Frosty came to life and does n't know what a traffic light or a lamp post is , the traffic cop lets Frosty go . At the train station , Frosty stows away aboard a refrigerated train car , since neither he nor the children have any money for a train ticket . As the train is about to leave the station , Karen and Hocus decide to join Frosty for the ride to keep him company . With that , Frosty , Karen , and Hocus wave goodbye to the other kids as the train takes off . Unbeknownst to them , Hinkle has also hitched a ride on the train , intending to get his hat back .   As the train continues up north , however , Frosty notices Karen is freezing and starting to catch a cold , so they jump off the train , leaving Hinkle behind once again . Hinkle , seeing them escape , jumps off the train too , but falls down a mountain and crashes into a tree where a pile of snow falls on him . At Frosty 's request , Hocus convinces some forest animals who are preparing for Christmas to build a campfire for Karen . Fearing that Karen still can not survive for long in the cold weather , Frosty asks Hocus who might be able to help them . Hocus suggests ( by pantomiming ) the President of the United States and the United States Marines , before suggesting Santa Claus . Frosty agrees , and promptly takes credit for the idea himself ( much to Hocus ' annoyance ) . Hocus hops off to get Santa , but Hinkle then confronts Frosty and Karen once more and blows out Karen 's campfire . Frosty and Karen are again forced to flee , this time with Karen riding on Frosty 's back as he slides head - first down a hill . At the bottom of the slope , Karen and Frosty discover a greenhouse filled with Christmas poinsettias . Despite Karen 's objections , Frosty steps inside the warm greenhouse with her , suggesting that he could afford to lose a little weight while she warms up . Unfortunately , an angry and vengeful Hinkle catches up to them immediately after and locks them in the greenhouse .   Hocus brings Santa Claus to the greenhouse only to find Karen in tears and Frosty melted on the floor due to Hinkle 's cruel act . Santa explains to Karen that Frosty is made from Christmas snow , and that he can never completely disappear , only take the form of summer rain , until next December . With a gust of cold wind through the open greenhouse door , the puddle that was Frosty blows out the door and magically changes back into his typical snowman form . Before Santa can put the finishing touch on Frosty and bring him back to life , as Hocus arrives with the hat , Hinkle arrives on the scene and again demands the return of his hat . He relents only when threatened with being removed from Santa 's Christmas list for the rest of his life if he put so much as one finger on the hat . Santa states that if Hinkle is truly repentant for his mean attitude and harming Frosty , and if he goes home and writes `` I am really sorry for what I did to Frosty '' a hundred zillion times , he may find a gift in his stocking on Christmas morning , which makes Hinkle bid Frosty and Karen farewell and run home to repeatedly write his apologies , assuming he may get a new hat . Finally , Santa then places the magic hat back on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman returns to life again . After celebrating , Santa takes Karen home and Frosty to the North Pole , but promises that Frosty will be back next winter .   The end credits show all the characters the next Christmas marching through the town square with Frosty in the lead , singing the `` Frosty the Snowman '' song . Among them is a redeemed Professor Hinkle , who is proudly wearing his new top hat . At the end of the parade , Frosty gets back into Santa 's waiting sleigh and they return to the North Pole , with Frosty proclaiming , `` I 'll be back on Christmas Day !

The CBC holds broadcast rights in Canada . The special also airs on Freeform in some territories . However , CBS does not own the telecast rights to the 1976 sequel Frosty 's Winter Wonderland ( that special currently airs on Freeform 's 25 Days of Christmas each year ) , which prompted CBS to produce its own `` sequel '' of sorts , Frosty Returns ( see below ) .   Home Media ( edit )   VHS and LaserDisc ( edit )   Family Home Entertainment released Frosty the Snowman on VHS as part of the Christmas Classics Series in 1989 and 1993 , with multiple re-prints throughout the 1990s . It was paired with The Little Drummer Boy on LaserDisc in 1992 . Upon its 1989 and 1993 releases , the special was also bundled in box sets with the other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , the 1973 Chuck Jones holiday special , A Very Merry Cricket and the sequel Frosty Returns which aired on CBS in 1992 . In 1998 , Sony Wonder and Golden Books Family Entertainment released the special on VHS , and also paired it with these other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Cricket on the Hearth in the separate Holiday Classics Collection box sets .   DVD and Blu - ray ( edit )   The special was also released on DVD by Sony Wonder and Classic Media in 2002 and 2004 , and by Genius Entertainment in 2007 . Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment released it on DVD and Blu - ray on October 12 , 2010 , and on the DVD / Blu - ray combo pack on November 6 , 2012 . Most DVD releases also include Frosty Returns . On September 8 , 2015 , Classic Media released both the special and Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town in their 45th Anniversary Collector 's Edition on Blu - ray and DVD in addition to the 50th Anniversary release of Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer in 2014 .   Sequels ( edit )   Frosty returned in several sequels :    Frosty 's Winter Wonderland -- This 1976 sequel by Rankin / Bass was also written by Romeo Muller . Narration is provided by Andy Griffith ( Durante had suffered a stroke that had forced his retirement in 1972 and eventually killed him ) . Jackie Vernon once again reprised his role as the voice of Frosty . Animation is produced by Topcraft in Japan . Unlike the original , the sequel takes place later in the winter season and is based upon the 1934 song `` Winter Wonderland ; '' it features Frosty 's pursuit of a wife and efforts to preserve him into the springtime . Furthermore , it makes no mention whatsoever of Christmas ; in fact it could be considered more a `` winter solstice '' special than a Christmas special as it celebrates the season of winter .   Rudolph and Frosty 's Christmas in July -- This 1979 Rankin / Bass feature - length sequel was filmed in `` Animagic '' stop - motion animation in the style of Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer and Rudolph 's Shiny New Year . While the Frosty specials were 30 minutes long , and the Rudolph specials were 60 minutes , this ambitious special was feature length , at 97 minutes long ( 120 minutes on television , including commercials ) . Vernon once again played the role of Frosty , in his last time for Rankin / Bass playing the voice of Frosty . This film features Frosty and his family as supporting characters . This is the only other Frosty cartoon to mention Christmas or Santa Claus in addition to the 1969 original .   Frosty Returns -- This 1992 half - hour special is not truly a sequel to the 1969 classic , as it was produced not by Rankin / Bass but by CBS . The characters , setting , voices and animation ( by Bill Melendez ) are vastly different . Despite this , it is shown with the original special every year on CBS and was even included as a bonus on its DVD release . John Goodman provides the voice of Frosty in this special , and Jonathan Winters serves as narrator . Frosty 's appearance is physically different , his personality and humor have changed , and he has the ability to live without his top hat , in direct contrast with the original and its other sequels . Also in contrast to the original specials , the special avoids all mention of Christmas ( despite the special portraying the beginning of winter ) and has an environmentalist theme , as Frosty works to stop a corporate executive whose product wipes out snow packs with one spray .   The Legend of Frosty the Snowman -- This 2005 straight - to - video film was produced by Classic Media , the previous rights holder for the original Rankin / Bass special , and the remainder of their pre-1974 library . This movie has been bundled with the original 1969 Rankin / Bass special and the CBS sequel , and has also aired on Cartoon Network . The appearance of Frosty resembles much more the Rankin / Bass character design from their original animation , and Professor Hinkle returns in two cameo appearances -- shown in a picture and flashback . Frosty is voiced by Bill Fagerbakke , best known as the voice of Patrick Star on SpongeBob SquarePants . And it , like Frosty Returns and Frosty 's Winter Wonderland , also never mentions anything to do with Christmas whatsoever .    References ( edit )    Jump up ^ TV Guide Guide to TV .

Acadian flag  The Acadians ( French : Acadiens ) are the descendants of the French settlers , and sometimes the Indigenous peoples , of parts of Acadia ( French : Acadie ) in the northeastern region of North America comprising what is now the Canadian Maritime Provinces of New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and Prince Edward Island , Gaspé , in Quebec , and to the Kennebec River in southern Maine .   The history of the Acadians was significantly influenced by the six colonial wars that took place in Acadia during the 17th and 18th century ( see the four French and Indian Wars , Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) . Eventually , the last of the colonial wars -- the French and Indian War -- resulted in the British Expulsion of the Acadians from the region . After the war , many Acadians came out of hiding or returned to Acadia from the British Colonies . Others remained in France and some migrated from there to Louisiana , where they became known as Cajuns , a corruption of the word Acadiens or Acadians . The nineteenth century saw the beginning of the Acadian Renaissance and the publication of Evangeline , which helped galvanize Acadian identity . In the last century Acadians have made achievements in the areas of equal language and cultural rights as a minority group in the Maritime provinces of Canada .

The trading monopoly of de Monts was cancelled in 1607 , and most of the French settlers returned to France , although some remained with the natives . Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint - Just led a second expedition to Port Royal in 1610 .   Arrival of the first European families ( edit )   The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region . In the early years of Acadian settlement , this included a small number of recorded marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women . Some records have survived showing marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women in formal Roman Catholic rites , for example , the marriage of Charles La Tour to a Mi'kmaw woman in 1626 . There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites , and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities . Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Françoise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 .   Governor Isaac de Razilly 's administration at LaHave , Nova Scotia , prepared the ground for the arrival of the first recorded migrant families on board the Saint Jehan , which left La Rochelle on 1 April 1636 . There were a number of sailings from the French Atlantic Coast to Acadia between 1632 and 1636 , but this is the only one for which a detailed passenger list has survived . Nicolas Denys , who was stationed across the LaHave River at Port Rossingol ( Liverpool Bay ) , acted as agent for the Saint Jehan . After a 35 - day crossing of the Atlantic , the Saint Jehan arrived on 6 May 1636 at LaHave , Nova Scotia . There were seventy - eight passengers and eighteen crew members . With this ship , Acadia began a slow shift from being primarily a matter of explorers and traders , of men , to a colony of permanent settlers , including women and children . While the presence of European women is a signal that settlement was seriously contemplated , there were yet so few of them in this group of migrants that they did not immediately affect the status of Acadia as basically a colony of European transients . By the end of the year , the migrants were moved from LaHave and re-established at Port Royal . At Port Royal in 1636 , Pierre Martin and Catherine Vigneau , who had arrived on the Saint Jehan , were the first European parents to have a child in Acadia . The first - born child was Mathieu Martin . In part because of this distinction , Mathieu Martin later became the Seigneury of Cobequid ( 1699 ) .   Kennedy ( 2014 ) argues that the emigrants from the Vienne region of France carried to Acadia their customs and social structure . They were frontier people , who dispersed their settlements based on kinship . They optimized use of farmland and emphasized trading for a profit . They were hierarchical and politically active . The French and the Acadian villages were similar in terms of prosperity , egalitarianism , and independent - mindedness . Kennedy says the emergence of a distinct Acadian identity emerged from the gradual adaptation of traditional French methods , institutions , and ideas to the North American environmental and political situations .   Civil War ( edit )  Siege of St. John ( 1645 ) - d'Aulnay defeats La Tour in Acadia Main article : Acadian Civil War  With the death of Isaac de Razilly , Acadia was plunged into what some historians have described as a civil war ( 1640 -- 1645 ) . Acadia had two legitimate Lieutenant Governors . The war was between Port Royal , where Governor Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay was stationed , and present - day Saint John , New Brunswick , where Governor Charles de Saint - Étienne de la Tour was stationed .   In the war , there were four major battles . La Tour attacked d'Aulnay at Port Royal in 1640 . In response to the attack , D'Aulnay sailed out of Port Royal to establish a five - month blockade of La Tour 's fort at Saint John , which La Tour eventually defeated ( 1643 ) . La Tour attacked d'Aulnay again at Port Royal in 1643 . D'Aulnay and Port Royal ultimately won the war against La Tour with the 1645 siege of Saint John . After d'Aulnay died ( 1650 ) , La Tour re-established himself in Acadia .   English colony ( 1654 -- 1667 ) ( edit )   In 1654 , war between France and England broke out . Led by Major Robert Sedgwick , a flotilla from Boston , under orders from Cromwell , arrived in Acadia to chase the French out . The flotilla seized La Tour 's fort , then Port - Royal . La Tour , nevertheless , managed to find himself in England , where , with the support of John Kirke , succeeded in receiving from Cromwell a part of Acadia , along with Sir Thomas Temple . La Tour returned to Cap - de-Sable where he remained until his death in 1666 at the age of 70 .   During the English occupation of Acadia , Jean - Baptiste Colbert , Louis XIV 's minister , forbade the Acadians from returning to France . As a result of the English occupation , no new French families settled in Acadia between 1654 and 1670 .   Post Treaty of Breda ( edit )  Marker commemorating the Dutch conquest of Acadia ( 1674 ) , which they renamed New Holland . This is the spot where Jurriaen Aernoutsz buried a bottle at the capital of Acadia , Fort Pentagouet , Castine , Maine .  The Treaty of Breda , signed 31 July 1667 , returned Acadia to France . A year later , Marillon du Bourg arrived to take possession of the territory for France . The son of LeBorgne , Alexandre LeBorgne , was named provisionary governor and lieutenant - general of Acadia . He married Marie Motin - La Tour , the eldest child of the marriage between La Tour and d'Aulnay's widow .   In 1670 , the new governor of Acadia , the chevalier Hubert d'Andigny , chevalier de Grandfontaine , was responsible for the first census undertaken in Acadia . The results did not include those Acadians living with local First Nations . It revealed that there were approximately sixty Acadian families with approximately 300 inhabitants in total . These inhabitants were predominantly engaged in aboiteau farming along the shores of the present day Bay of Fundy . No serious attempt was made to increase the population of Acadia .   In the spring of 1671 , more than fifty colonists left La Rochelle aboard the l'Oranger . Others arrived from Canada ( New France ) or were retired soldiers . During this time , a number of colonists married with the local First Nations . Some of the first to marry were Charles de Saint - Étienne de La Tour , Martin , Pierré Lejeune -- Briard , Jehan Lambert , Petitpas and Guidry . The capitan , Vincent de Saint - Castin , the commander at Pentagoet , married Marie Pidikiwamiska , the daughter of an Abenakis chief .   In 1674 , the Dutch briefly conquered Acadia , renaming the colony New Holland .   During the last decades of the seventeenth century , Acadians migrated from the capital , Port Royal , and established what would become the other major Acadian settlements before the Expulsion of the Acadians : Grand Pré , Chignecto , Cobequid and Pisiguit . Although not common , on occasion epidemics ravished the population of Ile St. - Jean , Ile Royale and Acadia . In 1732 / 33 more than 150 people died of smallpox on Ile Royale .   The history of the settlers of Ile St. - Jean prior to the expulsion includes extreme hardship . For almost every good harvest year it seems that there was one in which crops failed . In one or two instances widespread fires destroyed crops , livestock and farms . Famine and starvation were common and frequently occasioned desperate pleas for supplies from Louisbourg , Québec and even France itself . In 1756 , famine on Ile St. - Jean prompted authorities to relocate some families to Québec .   Prior to the founding of Halifax ( 1749 ) , Port Royal / Annapolis Royal was the capital of Acadia and later Nova Scotia for most of the previous 150 years . During that time the British made six attempts to conquer Acadia by defeating the capital . They finally defeated the French in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1710 ) . Over the following fifty years , the French and their allies made six unsuccessful military attempts to regain the capital .   Colonial wars ( edit )  Acadians at Annapolis Royal by Samuel Scott , 1751 ; earliest known image of Acadians Main article : Military history of the Acadians  There was already a long history of Acadian and Wabanaki Confederacy resistance to the British occupation of Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars and two local wars ( Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) before the Expulsion of the Acadians . The Mi'kmaq and the Acadians were allies through Catholicism and through numerous inter-marriages . The Mi'kmaq held the military strength in Acadia even after the conquest of 1710 . They primarily resisted the British occupation of Acadia and were joined in their efforts on numerous occasions by Acadians .   While many Acadians traded with the New England Protestants , Acadians ' participation in the wars clearly indicated that many were reluctant to be ruled by the British . During the first colonial war , King William 's War ( 1688 -- 97 ) , the crews of the very successful French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste were primarily Acadian . The Acadians resisted during the Raid on Chignecto ( 1696 ) . During Queen Anne 's War , Mi'kmaq and Acadians resisted during the Raid on Grand Pré , Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704 . The Acadians also assisted the French in protecting the capital in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1707 ) and the final Conquest of Acadia . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq were also successful in the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) .  Acadians by Samuel Scott , Annapolis Royal , 1751  During Father Rale 's War , the Maliseet raided numerous vessels on the Bay of Fundy while the Mi'kmaq engaged in the Raid on Canso , Nova Scotia ( 1723 ) . In the latter engagement , the Mi'kmaq were aided by Acadians . During King George 's War , Abbe Jean - Louis Le Loutre led many efforts which involved both Acadians and Mi'kmaq to recapture the capital such as the Siege of Annapolis Royal ( 1744 ) . During this siege , French officer Marin had taken British prisoners and stopped with them further up the bay at Cobequid . While at Cobequid , an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have `` left their ( the English ) carcasses behind and brought their skins '' . Le Loutre was also joined by prominent Acadian resistance leader Joseph Broussard ( Beausoleil ) . Broussard and other Acadians were involved in supporting the French soldiers in the Battle of Grand Pré .   During Father Le Loutre 's War , the conflict continued . The Mi'kmaq attacked New England Rangers in the Siege of Grand Pré and Battle at St. Croix . Upon the founding of Dartmouth , Nova Scotia , Broussard and the Mi'kmaq conducted numerous raids on the village , such as the Raid on Dartmouth ( 1751 ) , to try to stop the Protestant migration into Nova Scotia . ( Similarly , during the French and Indian War , Mi'kmaq , Acadians and Maliseet also engaged in numerous raids on Lunenburg , Nova Scotia , to stop the migration , such as the Raid on Lunenburg ( 1756 ) . ) Le Loutre and Broussard also worked together to resist the British occupation of Chignecto ( 1750 ) and then later they fought together with Acadians in the Battle of Beausejour ( 1755 ) . ( As early as the summer of 1751 , La Valiere reported , approximately 250 Acadians had already enrolled in the local militia at Fort Beausejour . )   When Charles Lawrence took over the post following Hopson 's return to England , he took a stronger stance . He was not only a government official but a military leader for the region . Lawrence came up with a military solution for the forty - five years of an unsettled British conquest of Acadia . The French and Indian War ( and Seven Years ' War in Europe ) began in 1754 . Lawrence 's primary objectives in Acadia were to defeat the French fortifications at Beausejour and Louisbourg . The British saw many Acadians as a military threat in their allegiance to the French and Mi'kmaq . The British also wanted to interrupt the Acadian supply lines to Fortress Louisbourg , which , in turn , supplied the Mi'kmaq .   French and Indian War ( edit )  Main article : Great Upheaval St. John River Campaign : Raid on Grimrose ( present day Gagetown , New Brunswick ) . This is the only contemporaneous image of the Expulsion of the Acadians .  The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710 . Over the next forty - five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain . During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour . During the French and Indian War , the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia .   Many Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better , while other Acadians did not sign because they were clearly anti-British . For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath , there were numerous reasons why they did not . The difficulty was partly religious , in that the British monarch was the head of the ( Protestant ) Church of England . Another significant issue was that an oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime . A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq . As a result , signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in danger of attack from Mi'kmaq .   In the Grand Dérangement ( the Great Upheaval ) , more than 12,000 Acadians ( three - fourths of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia ) were expelled from the colony between 1755 and 1764 . The British destroyed around 6,000 Acadian houses and dispersed the Acadians among the 13 colonies from Massachusetts to Georgia . The single event that involved the most deaths of Acadians was the sinking of the Duke William . Although there were no purposeful attempts to separate families , this did occur in the chaos of the eviction .  Siege of Louisbourg ( 1758 ) Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance ( edit ) Marquis de Boishébert - Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot ( 1753 )  With the Expulsion of the Acadians during the French and Indian War , the Mi'kmaq and Acadian resistance intensified . After the Expulsion began , much of the resistance was led by Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq again engaged victoriously in the Battle of Petitcodiac ( 1755 ) and the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1757 ) . Acadians who were being deported from Annapolis Royal , Nova Scotia , on the ship Pembroke defeated the British crew and sailed to land . There was also resistance during the St. John River Campaign . Boishebert also ordered the Raid on Lunenburg ( 1756 ) . In the spring of 1756 , a wood - gathering party from Fort Monckton ( former Fort Gaspareaux ) , was ambushed and nine of them were scalped .   In the April 1757 , a band of Acadian and Mi'kmaq raided a warehouse near Fort Edward , killing thirteen British soldiers and , after taking what provisions they could carry , setting fire to the building . A few days later , the same partisans also raided Fort Cumberland .   Some Acadians escaped into the woods and lived with the Mi'kmaq ; some bands of partisans fought the British , including a group led by Joseph Broussard , known as `` Beausoleil '' , along the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick . Some followed the coast northward , facing famine and disease . Some were recaptured , facing deportation or imprisonment at Fort Beausejour ( renamed Fort Cumberland ) until 1763 .   Some Acadians became indentured servants in the British colonies . Massachusetts passed a law in November 1755 placing the Acadians under the custody of `` justices of the peace and overseers of the poor '' ; Pennsylvania , Maryland , and Connecticut adopted similar laws . The Province of Virginia under Robert Dinwiddie initially agreed to resettle about one thousand Acadians who arrived in the colony but later ordered most deported to England , writing that the `` French people '' were `` intestine enemies '' that were `` murdering and scalping our frontier Settlers '' .   In 1758 , after the fall of Louisbourg , over 3,000 Acadians were deported to northern France . Resettlement attempts were tried in Châtellerault , Nantes , and Belle Île off Brittany . The French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon near Newfoundland became a safe harbor for many Acadian families until they were once again deported by the British in 1778 and 1793 .   Re-establishing in Nova Scotia ( edit )   After the end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 , Acadians were allowed to return to Nova Scotia as long as they did not settle in any one area in large numbers ; they were not permitted to resettle in the areas of Port Royal or Grand - Pré . Some Acadians resettled along the Nova Scotia coast and remain scattered across Nova Scotia to this day . Many dispersed Acadians looked for other homes . Beginning in 1764 , groups of Acadians began to arrive in Louisiana ( which had passed to Spanish control in 1762 ) . They eventually became known as Cajuns .   Beginning in the 1770s , many Acadians were encouraged to return through the policies of Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin , who guaranteed Catholic worship , land grants and issued a promise that there would be no second expulsion ( At this time , Nova Scotia included present - day New Brunswick ) . However the fertile Acadian dykelands had been resettled by New England Planters , who were soon followed by Loyalists who further occupied former Acadian lands . Returning Acadians and those families who had escaped expulsion had to settle in other parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , in most cases isolated and infertile lands . The new Acadian settlements were forced to focus more on fishery and later forestry .   Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included :    1767 St. Pierre et Miquelon   1772 census   1774 Founding of Saint - Anne 's church ; the Acadian school at Rustico and the abby Jean - Louis Beaubien ; the Trappistines in Tracadie   1785 Displacement from Fort Sainte - Anne to the upper Saint John River valley ( Madawaska )    Nineteenth century ( edit )   Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included :    Jean - Mandé Sigogne ( 6 April 1763 -- 9 November 1844 ) was a French Catholic priest , who moved to Canada after the Revolution and became known for his missionary work among the Acadians of Nova Scotia .   1836 Simon d'Entremont and Frédéric Robichaud , MLAs in N.S.   1846 Amand Landry , MLA in N.B.   1847 , Longfellow publishes Evangeline   1854 , Stanislaw - Francois Poirier , MLA in P.E.I   1854 , the seminary Saint - Thomas in Memramcook , New Brunswick , becomes the first upper - level school for Acadians   1859 , the first history of Acadia is published in French by Edme Rameau de Saint - Père ; Acadians begin to become aware of their own existence    Acadian Renaissance ( edit )  Le Moniteur Acadien - first Acadian newspaper ( 1867 )   1864 founding of the Farmers ' Bank of Rustico , the earliest known community bank in Canada , under the leadership of Rev.

More than 5,000 Acadians participated in the convention . It was decided that August 15 , the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary , would be chosen to celebrate Acadian culture as National Acadian Day . Other debates at the convention centered around education , agriculture , emigration , colonization , and newspapers , and these same issues would arise at subsequent conventions .   At the second convention , on August 15 , 1884 , in Miscouche , Prince Edward Island , the Acadian flag , an anthem - Ave Maris Stella , and a motto - L'union fait la force were adopted .   1885 , John A. Macdonald nominates Pascal Poirier from Shediac as the first Acadian senator ; a second Acadian newspaper published , Le Courrier des Provinces Maritimes   1887 , the newspaper L'Evangéline begins being published from Digby , later , in 1905 , moves to Moncton   1890 , third Acadian convention    Twentieth century ( edit )   Milestones of the Acadian Renaissance    1912 , Monsigneur Edouard LeBlanc is the first Acadian bishop in The Maritimes   1917 , the Conservative Aubin - Edmond Arsenault becomes the first Acadian premier of P.E.I.   1920 , 2nd Acadian bishop , Mgr Alexandre Chiasson in Chatham and later Bathurst ; la Société nationale de l'Assomption undertakes a campaign to build a commemorative church in Grand - Pré , Nova Scotia   1923 , Pierre - Jean Véniot becomes the first Acadian premier of N.B. but was not elected   1936 , the first Caisse Populaire Acadien in Petit - Rocher is founded ; the committee France - Acadie is founded   1955 , the first Tintamarre occurs .      An Acadian home along Cabot Trail , Cape Breton , Nova Scotia , 1938     An Acadian lady spinning wool , 1938     An Acadian lady making a rug , 1938     The quiet revolution ( edit )   Louis Robichaud , popularly known as `` P'tit - Louis '' , was the first elected Acadian Premier of New Brunswick , serving from 1960 to 1970 . First elected to the legislature in 1952 , he became provincial Liberal leader in 1958 and led his party to victory in 1960 , 1963 , and 1967 .   Robichaud modernized the province 's hospitals and public schools and introduced a wide range of reforms in an era that became known as the quiet revolution . To carry out these reforms , Robichaud restructured the municipal tax regime , expanded the government and sought to ensure that the quality of health care , education and social services was the same across the province -- a programme he called equal opportunity , is still a buzzword in New Brunswick .   Critics accused of Robichaud 's government of `` robbing Peter to pay Pierre '' with the assumption being that rich municipalities were Anglophone ones and poor municipalities were Francophone ones . While it was true that the wealthier municipalities were predominantly in certain English - speaking areas , areas with significantly inferior services were to be found across the province in all municipalities .   Robichaud was instrumental in the formation of New Brunswick 's only French - speaking university , the Université de Moncton , in 1963 , which serves the Acadian population of the Maritime provinces .   His government also passed an act in 1969 making New Brunswick officially bilingual . `` Language rights '' , he said when he introduced the legislation , `` are more than legal rights . They are precious cultural rights , going deep into the revered past and touching the historic traditions of all our people . ''   1977 , official opening of the Acadian Historic Village in Caraquet , New Brunswick .   Antonine Maillet ( edit )   Born 1929 in Bouctouche , Antonine Maillet is an Acadian novelist , playwright , and scholar . Maillet received a BA and MA from the Université de Moncton , followed by a Ph. D. in literature in 1970 from the Université Laval . Maillet won the 1972 Governor General 's Award for Fiction for Don l'Orignal . In 1979 , Maillet published Pélagie - la - Charrette , for which she won the prix Goncourt . Maillet 's character `` La Sagouine '' ( from her book of the same name ) is the inspiration for `` Le Pays de la Sagouine '' in her hometown of Bouctouche .   Twenty - first century ( edit )   In 2003 , at the request of Acadian representatives , a proclamation was issued in the name of Queen Elizabeth II , acting as the Canadian monarch , officially acknowledging the deportation and establishing July 28 as a day of commemoration . The day of commemoration is observed by the Government of Canada , as the successor of the British Government .   Acadian remembrance day ( edit )   The Fédération des Associations de Familles Acadiennnes of New Brunswick and the Société Saint - Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island has resolved that December 13 each year shall be commemorated as `` Acadian Remembrance Day '' in remembrance of all Acadians who died as a result of the deportation . The date December 13 was chosen to commemorate the sinking of the Duke William and the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from Île - Saint Jean who perished in the North Atlantic from hunger , disease and drowning in 1758 . The event has been commemorated annually since 2004 and participants mark the event by wearing a black star .   Acadian World Congress ( edit )   Beginning in 1994 , the Acadian community gathered for an Acadian World Congress in New Brunswick . The congress has been held every 5 years since then : in Louisiana in 1999 , in Nova Scotia in 2004 , in the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick in 2009 . The 5th Acadian World Congress was hosted in 2014 by a gathering of 40 different communities located in three different provinces and different states in two countries . Northwestern New Brunswick and Témiscouata , Quebec , in Canada as well as Northern Maine in the United States joined hands to host the 5th CMA .

They cover most of the North Carolina coastline , separating the Currituck Sound , Albemarle Sound , and Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic Ocean .   The Outer Banks are a major tourist destination and are known around the world for their subtropical climate and wide expanse of open beachfront . The Cape Hatteras National Seashore has four campgrounds open to visitors . The treacherous seas off the Outer Banks and the large number of shipwrecks that have occurred there have given these seas the nickname Graveyard of the Atlantic . The Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum is located in Hatteras Village near a United States Coast Guard facility and the Hatteras ferry .   The English Roanoke Colony -- where Virginia Dare was born -- vanished from Roanoke Island in 1587 . The Lost Colony , written and performed to commemorate the original colonists , is the second longest running outdoor drama in the United States and its theater acts as a cultural focal point for much of the Outer Banks .   The Wright brothers ' first flight in a controlled , powered , heavier - than - air vehicle took place on the Outer Banks on December 17 , 1903 , at Kill Devil Hills near the seafront town of Kitty Hawk . The Wright Brothers National Monument commemorates the historic flights , and First Flight Airport is a small , general - aviation airfield located there .

From north to south , the largest of these include : Bodie Island ( which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes ) , Hatteras Island , Ocracoke Island , Portsmouth Island , and the Core Banks . Over time , the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up , often during a breach created during violent storms , and older inlets close , usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution .   The Outer Banks stretch southward from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach down the North Carolina coastline . Sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the Outer Banks . Generations of North Carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state 's three prominent capes : Cape Hatteras , Cape Lookout , and Cape Fear . Other sources limit the definition to two capes ( Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout ) and coastal areas in four counties ( Currituck County , Dare County , Hyde County , and Carteret County ) . Some authors include Carteret 's Shackelford Banks and Bogue Banks in their descriptions , while others exclude Bogue Banks . Still other references restrict the definition to the northern three counties of Currituck , Dare , and Hyde .   The abbreviations OBX ( Outer Banks ) and SOBX ( Southern Outer Banks ) are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers , t - shirts , and other items to vacationers . OBX , which originated first , is generally used in the northern Outer Banks . SOBX is used primarily in Carteret County , which is also known as the Crystal Coast .   The northern part of the Outer Banks , from Oregon Inlet northward , is actually a part of the North American mainland , since the northern inlets of Bodie Island and Currituck Banks no longer exist . It is separated by the Currituck Sound and the Intracoastal Waterway , which passes through the Great Dismal Swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the Outer Banks . Road access to the northern Outer Banks is cut off between Sandbridge and Corolla , North Carolina , with communities such as Carova Beach accessible only by four - wheel drive vehicles . North Carolina State Highway 12 links most of the popular Outer Banks communities in this section of the coast . The easternmost point is Cape Point at Cape Hatteras on Hatteras Island , site of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse .   The Outer Banks are not anchored to offshore coral reefs like some other barrier islands and as a consequence they often suffer significant beach erosion during major storms . In fact , their location jutting out into the Atlantic makes them the most hurricane - prone area north of Florida , for both landfalling storms and brushing storms offshore . Hatteras Island was cut in half on September 18 , 2003 , when Hurricane Isabel washed a 2,000 foot ( 600 m ) wide and 15 foot ( 5 m ) deep channel called Isabel Inlet through the community of Hatteras Village on the southern end of the island . The tear was subsequently repaired and restored by sand dredging by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . It was cut off once again in 2011 by Hurricane Irene . Access to the island was largely limited to boat access only from August to late October until another temporary bridge could be built .   Vegetation ( edit )   The vegetation of the Outer Banks varies . In the northeast part of the Outer Banks , from Virginia Beach southward past the North Carolina border to Oregon Inlet , the main types of vegetation are sea grasses , beach grasses and other beach plants including Opuntia humifusa on the Atlantic side and wax myrtles , bays , and grasses on the Sound side with areas of pine and Spanish moss - covered live oaks . Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach . Sabal Minor palms were once indigenous to the entire Outer Banks , and they are still successfully planted and grown . Its current most northerly known native stand is on Monkey Island in Currituck County .   From Cape Hatteras National Seashore southward , the vegetation does include that of the northeastern Outer Banks such as Sabal minor , Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa ; however , the main vegetation consists of Cabbage palmetto ( Sabal palmetto ) , which can be found in the north , although they are native in the southern part of the Outer Banks , specifically prevalent from Cape Hatteras and all points southward . Pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the Outer Banks ; although , they are not indigenous to the area .   A wide variety of native plants can be found at the Elizabethan Gardens in Manteo on Roanoke Island . The gardens are open year round , 7 days a week .   Weather ( edit )   The Outer Banks have unusual weather patterns because of their unique geographical location . As the islands are jutted out from the eastern seaboard into the Atlantic Gulf Stream , the Outer Banks has a predisposition to be affected by hurricanes , Nor'easters ( usually in the form of rain , and rarely snow or mixed precipitation ) , and other ocean - driven storms .   The winters are typically milder than in inland areas , averaging lows in the upper 30s and highs in the lower 50s , and is more frequently overcast than in the summer . However , the exposure of the Outer Banks makes them prone to higher winds , often causing wind chills to make the apparent temperature as cold as the inland areas . The summer months average lows from the mid-70s to highs in the upper 80s , depending on the time of the summer . The spring and fall are typically milder seasons . The fall and winter are usually warmer than areas inland , while the spring and the summer are often slightly cooler because of the moderating effects of being surrounded by water .   Although snow is possible , averaging from 3 inches in the north to less than 1 / 2 inch per year in the south , there are many times when years pass between snowfalls . The majority of nor'easters are `` born '' off the coasts of the Outer Banks .   Culture ( edit )  Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum , Hatteras , North Carolina , June 2007  Archeologists believe that the Outer Banks were inhabited for well over a thousand years before the arrival of Europeans , with small branches of larger tribes , such as Algonquins , Chowanog , and Poteskeet , setting up homes all along the barrier islands from Corolla to Hatteras . European explorers to the Outer Banks as far back as the 1500s noted encountering the friendly Hatteras Island and Outer Banks natives , noting their hospitality to foreign explorers as well as their happiness and overall quality of life . European - borne diseases and migration to the mainland were likely the main causes for the decline of the native population .   Before bridges were built in the 1930s , the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat , which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland . This helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive Outer Banks accent or brogue , which sounds more like an English accent than it does an American accent . Many `` bankers '' have often been mistaken for being from England or Ireland when traveling to areas outside of the Outer Banks . The brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the Outer Banks , with it being the thickest on Ocracoke Island and Harkers Island .   Some residents of the Outer Banks , known as wreckers , made part of their living by scavenging wrecked ships -- or by luring ships to their destruction . Horses with lanterns tied to their necks would be walked along the beach ; the lanterns ' up and down motion would appear to ships to represent clear water and a ship ahead ; the unsuspecting captain would then drive his ship ashore following this false light .   The islands are home to herds of feral horses , sometimes called `` banker ponies , '' which according to local legend are descended from Spanish Mustangs washed ashore centuries ago in shipwrecks . Populations are found on Ocracoke Island , Shackleford Banks , Currituck Banks , and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary .   Ocracoke was the last refuge of pirate Edward Teach , better known as Blackbeard . It is also where the infamous pirate was killed November 22 , 1718 in a fierce battle with troops from Virginia .   The Outer Banks is home to Yaupon Holly ( Ilex vomitoria ) , the roasted leaves of which were brewed into a high caffeine beverage called black drink by the Native Americans . The Outer Banks may be one of the few places where it is still consumed .     Fishing ( edit )       This section contains content that is written like an advertisement .

( July 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The Outer Banks offers a multitude of fishing options for tourists as well as locals . There has been a long history of fishing in the Outer Banks , dating back to the end of the 17th century . Pirates ravaged the coast for the majority of the 1600s , but once they were ridden , the local settlers used fishing as their lifeline . Then , in the mid-19th century , large - scale commercial fishing erupted , mostly due to the construction of the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal , which simplified shipping methods for fishermen . Saltwater fishing became the cash - crop of the Outer Banks , and blossomed it into a popular tourist destination . In modern times , tourists will flock to the area just for the abundance of fishing opportunities . Anglers , otherwise known as fishermen , have a wide range of fishing methods , some of these methods date back to when the first settlers arrived , to choose from in the Outer Banks .    Fly fishing   This was brought about in the 1950s when modern fly fishing experts like , Joe Brooks and Jimmy Albright , were successfully catching a variety of gamefish on the flats of the Florida Keys and on the Currituck Sound , which is included in the stretch of the Outer Banks . Modern fly fishers in the Outer Banks pursue a variety of gamefish from red drum , to marlin and tuna .   Brackish fishing   This is a separate type of fishing than complete saltwater because of the abundance of new species that are able to live in brackish water . The Outer Banks has multiple Sounds that receive water from the Atlantic Ocean and many North Carolina fresh - water rivers , creating an estuary for many types of fish including , striped bass , puppy drum , and speckled trout .   Offshore fishing   Thriving in the Outer Banks , this is the type of fishing this area is known for . Offshore fishing is the method of heading out to sea to the Gulf Stream , where giant species such as billfish , tuna and dolphin lurk . Anglers can book charters or use their own personal boat , but a larger boat is necessary to reach the deep water where the big fish are prevalent .   Inshore fishing   Guides local to the Outer Banks will often escort new anglers around the area to sounds and piers where they are guaranteed a catch . Whether the customer is a novice or veteran with their fishing skills , the inshore guide is someone that is there to help .   Pier fishing   The Outer Banks are one of the few coastal areas left with more than one fishing pier along the coast , so anglers attract to the area for an opportunity to pier fish . Pier Fishing is an easy way for anglers to get a little off - shore mixed with some inshore fishing . It is where fishermen can catch any type of fish they please , as long as it is the season for it .    The Outer Banks are a popular destination for bottom fish like spot and mullet , these two types of fish are caught throughout the year . The peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of May . If the angler is solely searching for top water fish , then late May and June would be the ideal time to fish , especially if they are searching for Mackerel . In the offseason , or winter months , the true fishermen are out searching for Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin Tuna , Oysters , King Mackerel , Bay Scallops , and Striped Bass . In the spring , the popular catches are Grouper , Sea Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin and Yellowfin tuna , Oysters , Snapper , Striped Bass , Red Drum , Croaker , Sea Mullet , King Mackerel , and Wahoo Late Spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top - water fish to move into the coastal waters near the Outer Banks , because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water The top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water Plus they will start to migrate back North as the coastal waters to the south become too hot , the waters farther North will warm to their desired temperatures . Yet , in the prime tourist season of the summer , fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as blue Marlin , White Marlin , Dolphin , Wahoo , Cobia , King Mackerel , Bluefish , Tuna , Flounder , snapper , Grouper , Spanish Mackerel , Crabs , Soft Crabs , Shrimp , Spot , Croaker , Sailfish , and Sea Mullet . By the fall , most tourists have started to leave , but fishermen are still out searching for Snapper , Channel Bass , Bluefish , King Mackerel , Grouper , Tuna , Oysters , Striped Bass , Sea Mullet , Spot , Clams , Speckled Trout , Flounder , and Shrimp . The prime season for fall fishing is late September to October 23 . Though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast prevailing winds , there is still some big game fish left . Most of these fish are vacating back to the South for the warm waters . This makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky , colder water .

( December 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In 1900 , the First Philippine Commission passed Act No. 52 , which placed all banks under the Bureau of the Treasury and authorizing the Insular Treasurer to supervise and examine banks and all banking activity . In 1929 , the Department of Finance , through the Bureau of Banking , took over bank supervision .   By 1933 , a group of Filipinos had conceptualised a central bank for the Philippine Islands . It came up with the rudiments of a bill for the establishment of a central bank after a careful study of the economic provisions of the Hare -- Hawes -- Cutting Act , which would grant Philippine independence after 12 years , but reserving military and naval bases for the United States and imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports . However , the Hare -- Hawes -- Cutting Act would be rejected by the Senate of the Philippines at the urging of Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon . This Senate then advocated a new bill that won United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's support , this would be the Tydings -- McDuffie Act , which would grant Philippine independence on July 4 , 1946 .   Under the Commonwealth , discussions continued regarding the idea of a Philippine central bank that would promote price stability and economic growth . The country 's monetary system then was administered by the Department of Finance and the National Treasury , and the Philippine piso was on the exchange standard using the United States dollar , which was backed by 100 percent gold reserve , as the standard currency .   As required by the Tydings -- McDuffie Act , the National Assembly of the Philippines in 1939 passed a law establishing a central bank . As it was a monetary law , it required the approval of the President of the United States ; Franklin D. Roosevelt did not give his . A second law was passed in 1944 under the Japanese - controlled Second Republic during the Second World War , but the 1945 arrival of American liberation forces , aided by Philippine Commonwealth troops and recognised guerrillas , aborted its implementation .   Third Republic and martial law ( edit )   Shortly after President Manuel Roxas assumed office in 1946 , he instructed then - Finance Secretary Miguel Cuaderno , Sr. to draw up a charter for a central bank . The establishment of a monetary authority became imperative a year later as a result of the findings of the Joint Philippine - American Finance Commission chaired by Cuaderno . The Commission , which studied Philippine financial , monetary , and fiscal problems in 1947 , recommended a shift from the dollar exchange standard to a managed currency system . A central bank was necessary to implement the proposed shift to the new system .   Roxas then created the Central Bank Council to prepare the charter of a proposed monetary authority . It was submitted to Congress in February 1948 . By June of the same year , the newly proclaimed President Elpidio Quirino , who succeeded President Roxas , affixed his signature on Republic Act ( RA ) No. 265 , the Central Bank Act of 1948. On January 3 , 1949 , the Central Bank of the Philippines was formally inaugurated with Miguel Cuaderno , Sr. as the first governor . The main duties and responsibilities of the Central Bank were to promote economic development and maintain internal and external monetary stability .   Over the years , changes were introduced to make the charter more responsive to the needs of the economy . On November 29 , 1972 , President Ferdinand Marcos ' Presidential Decree No. 72 amended Republic Act No. 265 , emphasizing the maintenance of domestic and international monetary stability as the primary objective of the Central Bank . The Bank 's authority was also expanded to include regulation of the entire financial system of the Philippines and not just supervision of the banking system . In 1981 , RA 265 , as amended , was further improved to strengthen the financial system , among the changes was the increase in the capitalization of the Central Bank from Php 10 million to Php 10 billion .   In the 1973 Constitution , the interim Batasang Pambansa ( National Assembly ) was mandated to establish an independent central monetary authority . Presidential Decree No. 1801 designated the Central Bank of the Philippines as the central monetary authority ( CMA ) . Years later , the 1987 Constitution adopted the CMA provisions from the 1973 Constitution that were aimed essentially at establishing an independent monetary authority through increased capitalization and greater private sector representation in the Monetary Board .   Present ( edit )   In accordance with a provision in the 1987 Constitution , President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act No. 7653 , otherwise known as the New Central Bank Act , into law on June 14 , 1993 . The law provides for the establishment of an independent monetary authority to be known as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas , its primary objective being the maintenance of price stability . This objective was only implied in the old Central Bank charter . The law also gives the Bangko Sentral fiscal and administrative autonomy which the old Central Bank did not have . On July 3 , 1993 , the New Central Bank Act took effect .  BSP Branch in Zamboanga City .  On the evening of September 26 , 2012 , a Wednesday , the BSP website was hacked by a group named Anonymous Philippines in a protest against the recently passed Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 . The website was promptly restored in the early hours of the following day .   On April 23 , 2013 , The Asian Banker named the BSP as the Best Macroeconomic Regulator in the Asia - Pacific Region for 2013 in The Asian Banker Leadership Achievement Awards in Jakarta , Indonesia . The BSP was cited as a `` good , strong , and fair - minded regulator . '' About a month later , the BSP was given the country award by the Child and Youth Finance International in its 2013 International Summit in Istanbul , Turkey , in recognition of its initiative to integrate financial education in the Philippine elementary school curriculum .   Roles and responsibilities ( edit )   As prescribed by the New Central Bank Act , the main functions of the Bangko Sentral are :    Liquidity management , by formulating and implementing monetary policy aimed at influencing money supply , consistent with its primary objective to maintain price stability ,   Currency issue . The BSP has the exclusive power to issue the national currency . All notes and coins issued by the BSP are fully guaranteed by the Government and are considered legal tender for all private and public debts ,   Lender of last resort , by extending discounts , loans and advances to banking institutions for liquidity purposes ,   Financial supervision , by supervising banks and exercising regulatory powers over non-bank institutions performing quasi-banking functions ,   Management of foreign currency reserves , by maintaining sufficient international reserves to meet any foreseeable net demands for foreign currencies in order to preserve the international stability and convertibility of the Philippine peso ,   Determination of exchange rate policy , by determining the exchange rate policy of the Philippines . Currently , the BSP adheres to a market - oriented foreign exchange rate policy , and   Being the banker , financial advisor and official depository of the Government , its political subdivisions and instrumentalities and GOCCs .    Organization of the Bangko Sentral ( edit )   The basic structure of the Bangko Sentral includes :    The Monetary Board , which exercises the powers and functions of the BSP , such as the conduct of monetary policy and supervision of the financial system ;   The Monetary Stability Sector , which takes charge of the formulation and implementation of the BSP 's monetary policy , including serving the banking needs of all banks through accepting deposits , servicing withdrawals and extending credit through the rediscounting facility ;   The Supervision and Examination Sector , which enforces and monitors compliance to banking laws to promote a sound and healthy banking system ; and   The Resource Management Sector , which serves the human , financial and physical resource needs of the BSP .    The powers and function of Bangko Sentral are exercised by its Monetary Board , whose seven members are appointed by the President of the Philippines . As provided for by RA 7653 or the New Central Bank Act , one of the government sector members of the Monetary Board must also be a member of Cabinet . Members of the Monetary Board are prohibited from holding certain positions in other government agencies and private institutions that may give rise to conflicts of interest . The members have fixed and overlapping terms , except for the Cabinet Secretary representing the incumbent administration .   The current members of the Monetary Board are :    Nestor Espenilla , Jr. , BSP Governor and Chairman of the Monetary Board   Carlos Dominguez III , Secretary of the Department of Finance   Antonio S. Abacan , Jr .   Juan D. De Zuñiga , Jr .   V. Bruce J. Tolentino   Felipe M. Medalla   Peter B. Favila    Convertible currencies ( edit )   The Bangko Sentral has 19 currencies directly convertible with the Philippine piso , which serves as a benchmark for all Philippine banks .       Australian dollar ( AUD )   Bahraini dinar ( BHD )   British pound ( GBP )   Brunei dollar ( BND )   Canadian dollar ( CAD )   Dominican peso ( DOP )   Chinese yuan ( CNY )   Euro ( EUR )   Hong Kong dollar ( HKD )         Indonesian rupiah ( IDR )   Japanese yen ( JPY )   Mexican peso ( MXN )   Korean won ( KRW )   Kuwaiti dinar ( KWD )   Saudi riyal ( SAR )   Singapore dollar ( SGD )   Swiss franc ( CHF )         Thai baht ( THB )   New Taiwan dollar ( TWD )   United Arab Emirates dirham ( AED )   United States dollar ( USD )         Microfinance and financial Inclusion ( edit )   In 2000 , the General Banking Law mandated the BSP to recognize microfinance as a legitimate banking activity and to set the rules and regulations for its practice within the banking sector . In the same year , the BSP declared microfinance as its flagship program for poverty alleviation . The BSP has become the prime advocate for the development of microfinance . To this end , the Bangko Sentral aims to :    Provide the enabling policy and regulatory environment ;   Increase the capacity of the BSP and banking sector on microfinance operations ; and   Promote and advocate for the development of sound and sustainable microfinance operations .    The Bank is active in promoting a financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion . It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration during the 2011 Global Policy Forum held in Mexico .   Anti-Money Laundering ( edit )   With money laundering being one of the problems of the Philippines , the BSP has issued a number of measures to bring the Philippines ' regulatory regime on money laundering closer to international standards . In September 2001 , the Anti-Money Laundering Act , or AMLA , was signed into law . The AMLA defined money laundering a criminal offense , and prescribed corresponding penalties . It also provided the foundation for a central monitoring and implementing council called the Anti-Money Laundering Council ( AMLC ) . The AMLC is composed of the Governor of the Bangko Sentral as Chair , and the Commissioner of the Insurance Commission and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission as members , all acting unanimously in the discharge of the group 's mandate .   In February 2013 , Philippine President Benigno Aquino III signed R.A. No. 10365 , known as An act further strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering Law , which aims to strengthen the AMLC by requiring that any suspicious transaction in foreign exchange , real estate , and jewelry and precious metal trading be reported .   Governors ( edit )  Main article : Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  Museum ( edit )   Within the Manila complex of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is the Museo ng Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( English : Museum of the Central Bank of the Philippines ) . Inaugurated on January 3 , 1999 , as part of the celebration of the 50 years of central banking in the Philippines , the museum showcases the Bank 's collection of currencies .   As repository and custodian of the country 's numismatic heritage , the Museo collects , studies and preserves coins , paper notes , medals , artifacts and monetary items found in the Philippines during its different historical periods . These collections have been placed on permanent display at the Museo .

Complementary paintings from the BSP art collection , together with chosen artifacts , enhance each gallery .   A panoramic memorabilia of 50 years of central banking in the Philippines , showcases the strides made in bringing about price stability , to sustain economic growth in the country . The exhibition hall also carries the busts of the governors of the Central Bank / Bangko Sentral .

Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources . ( October 2010 )     Takt time is the average time between the start of production of one unit and the start of production of the next unit , when these production starts are set to match the rate of customer demand . For example , if a customer wants 10 units per week , then , given a 40 - hour work week and steady flow through the production line , the average time between production starts should be 4 hours , yielding 10 units produced per week . Note , a common misconception is that takt time is related to the time it takes to actually make the product . In the previous example , whether it takes 4 minutes or 4 years to produce the product , the takt time should be 4 hours ( of course , the time it takes to produce the product will impact the magnitude of the number of units actually in production at any point in time ) .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Etymology   2 Definition   3 Implementation   4 See also   5 References   6 External links   7 Further reading      Etymology ( edit )   Takt time is a borrowing of the Japanese word takutotaimu ( タクト タイム ) , which in turn was borrowed from the German word Taktzeit , meaning clock interval . The word was likely introduced to Japan by German engineers in the 1930s .   Definition ( edit )   Assuming a product is made one unit at a time at a constant rate during the net available work time , the takt time is the amount of time that must elapse between two consecutive unit completions in order to meet the demand .   Takt time can be first determined with the formula :    T = T a D ( \\\\ displaystyle T = ( \\\\ frac ( T_ ( a ) ) ( D ) ) )    Where T = Takt time , e.g. ( work time between two consecutive units ) T = Net time available to work , e.g. ( work time per period ) D = Demand ( customer demand ) , e.g. ( units required per period )   Net available time is the amount of time available for work to be done . This excludes break times and any expected stoppage time ( for example scheduled maintenance , team briefings , etc . ) .   Example : If there are a total of 8 hours ( or 480 minutes ) in a shift ( gross time ) less 30 minutes lunch , 30 minutes for breaks ( 2 × 15 mins ) , 10 minutes for a team briefing and 10 minutes for basic maintenance checks , then the net Available Time to Work = 480 - 30 - 30 - 10 - 10 = 400 minutes .   If customer demand were 400 units a day and one shift were being run , then the line would be required to output at a minimum rate of one part per minute in order to be able to keep up with customer demand .   In reality , people and machines can not maintain 100 % efficiency and there will be stoppages for other reasons . Allowances should be made for these instances , and thus the line will be set up to run at a faster rate to account for this .   Also , takt time may be adjusted according to requirements within the company . For example , if one department delivers parts to several manufacturing lines , it often makes sense to use similar takt times on all lines to smooth out flow from the preceding station . Customer demand can still be met by adjusting daily working time , reducing down times on machines and so on .   Some of the early literature uses cycle time for takt time .   Implementation ( edit )   Takt time is calculated on virtually every task in a business environment . It is used in manufacturing ( casting of parts , drilling holes , or preparing a workplace for another task ) , control tasks ( testing of parts or adjusting machinery ) , or in administration ( answering standard inquiries or call center operation ) . It is , however , most common in production lines that move a product along a line of stations that each performs a set of predefined tasks .   Once a takt system is implemented there are a number of benefits :    The product moves along a line , so bottlenecks ( stations that need more time than planned ) are easily identified when the product does not move on in time .   Correspondingly , stations that do n't operate reliably ( suffer frequent breakdown , etc . ) are easily identified .   The takt leaves only a certain amount of time to perform the actual value added work . Therefore , there is a strong motivation to get rid of all non value - adding tasks ( like machine set - up , gathering of tools , transporting products , etc . )   Workers and machines perform sets of similar tasks , so they do n't have to adapt to new processes every day , increasing their productivity .   There is no place in the takt system for removal of a product from the assembly line at any point before completion , so opportunities for shrink and damage in transit are minimized .    Downsides of takt time organization include :    When customer demand rises so much that takt time has to come down , quite a few tasks have to be either reorganized to take even less time to fit into the shorter takt time , or they have to be split up between two stations ( which means another station has to be squeezed into the line and workers have to adapt to the new setup )   When one station in the line breaks down for whatever reason the whole line comes to a grinding halt , unless there are buffer capacities for preceding stations to get rid of their products and following stations to feed from . A built - in buffer of three to five percent downtime allows needed adjustments or recovery from failures .   Short takt time can put considerable stress on the `` moving parts '' of a production system or subsystem . In automated systems / subsystems , increased mechanical stress increases the likelihood of breakdown , and in non-automated systems / subsystems , personnel face both increased physical stress ( which increases the risk of repetitive motion ( also `` stress or `` strain '' ) injury ) , intensified emotional stress , and lowered motivation , sometimes to the point of increased absenteeism .   Tasks have to be leveled to make sure tasks do n't bulk in front of certain stations due to peaks in workload . This decreases the flexibility of the system as a whole .

The story features classic Seuss rhymes and drawings in his distinctive pen and ink style .   The book is a first - person narrative told by a young narrator who experiences troubles in his life ( mostly aggressive small animals that bite and sting ) and wishes to escape them . He sets out for the city of Solla Sollew ( `` where they never have troubles / at least very few '' ) and learns that he must face his problems instead of running away from them . He then goes back home to deal with his `` troubles '' , arming himself with a big bat and resolving that `` Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me ! ''   The journey includes several fantastic , and troublesome , encounters . In one instance , the protagonist is forced to haul a wagon for a bossy companion . ( `` ' This is called teamwork . I furnish the brains . You furnish the muscles , the aches and the pains . ' '' ) In another scene , he is drafted into the army under the command of the fearsome ( and , ultimately , cowardly ) General Genghis Kahn Schmitz , who abandons him at a critical moment .   Plot ( edit )   As the story opens , the young protagonist ( resembling a cat or dog ) lives a happy and carefree life in the Valley of Vung , but one day , all that changes when he goes out for a stroll to look at daisies and hurts himself by tripping over a rock , which sets off the troubles he will soon face . The protagonist vows to be more careful , but a green - headed Quilligan Quail bites his tail from behind ( `` I learned there are troubles of more than one kind ; Some come from ahead and some come from behind '' ) . Worse still , a Skritz dives to sting his neck and a Skrink bites his toe , proving that troubles can come from all directions .   As the protagonist tries to fight off his troubles , a man on a One Wheel Wubble drawn by a camel comes up and explains that like the protagonist , he too is experiencing a troubled life and has decided to escape his troubles by going to Solla Sollew , a city on the beautiful banks of the river Wah - Hoo , and known to never have troubles ( at least very few ) . He invites the protagonist to come along with him . Eager to escape his troubles , the protagonist joins the wubble driver , but after a long night of traveling , the camel gets sick and starts to bubble . At first , the driver and protagonist pull him on the wubble , but for the rest of the day , the driver acts lazy and has the protagonist do all the hard work .   The next day they thankfully discover a camel doctor , Dr. Sam Snell , who diagnoses their camel with a bad case of gleeks and orders him to bed for twenty weeks . The driver makes it up to the protagonist by telling him he can catch the 4 : 42 bus to Solla Sollew at the nearest bus stop , but when the protagonist gets to the bus stop he learns from a sign tacked on a stick that the Solla Sollew bound bus is out of service ( the driver , Butch Myers , apparently destroyed all his tires from accidentally running over four nails ) , leaving him to hike for one hundred miles . Soon , the poor protagonist is caught in a storm . A kindly stranger tells him that the storm is the infamous `` Midwinter Jicker '' and allows the protagonist to take shelter in his house , where a family of mice and a family of owls are also taking shelter .   After a sleepless night and dreaming of sleeping in Solla Sollew , the protagonist awakens to find that the flood - waters have washed the house over a cliff , with him still inside . He spends twelve days in the flood - waters , until somebody rescues him by throwing down a rope . The protagonist climbs the rope , only to discover that his savior is General Genghis Kahn Schmitz , who immediately drafts him into his army for an upcoming battle against the Perilous Poozer of Pompelmoose Pass , a lion - like creature . At the pass , the General discovers he and his army are outnumbered by too many Poozers and orders an immediate retreat without fighting , leaving the protagonist to face the Poozers alone , armed only with `` a shooter and one little bean '' .   The protagonist manages to escape the Poozers by diving down an air vent marked `` Vent No. 5 '' but has to spend the next three days trying to find his way through a network of tunnels inhabited by birds , all going in the wrong direction . Close to the end of the third day , he finally finds a door and discovers he 's come out at the beautiful banks of the river Wah - Hoo . Realizing he 's reached his goal , the protagonist rushes out to Solla Sollew .   At the gates of Solla Sollew , the protagonist is greeted by a friendly doorman . The doorman explains to the protagonist about the only trouble the city has : a key - slapping slippard has moved into the lock of the door , which happens to be the only way into Solla Sollew , and bugs the doorman by continuously slapping the key out of his hand , preventing anyone from entering the city . As it 's considered bad luck to kill a slippard , the doorman can not do anything to evict this pest , but decides instead to leave Solla Sollew for the city of Boola Boo Ball , on the banks of the beautiful river Woo - Wall , and known to never have troubles ( `` No troubles at all ! ! '' ) and invites the protagonist to come along .   At first , the protagonist considers joining the doorman , but realizing that he 's come all this way for nothing , the protagonist , instead , decides to go back home to the Valley of Vung and face his troubles . He now knows he will have troubles for the rest of his life , but he 's ready for them . Armed with a bat , the Protagonist now gives the rocks , quail , skritz , and skrink troubles of their own ( `` But I 've bought a big bat . I 'm all ready , you see . Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me ! '' ) .   In Seussical ( edit )   In Seussical , the character of General Genghis Kahn Schmitz makes an appearance as a secondary character . He introduces JoJo to the military school in song . This sets up a subplot concerning JoJo in which he is thought to be lost in battle . The character of Schmitz in the play is a cross between the Schmitz seen in the book and the unnamed generals in the Butter Battle Book .   Solla Sollew is the subject of a song in which the main characters yearn for a happy resolution to their problems . It is referred to as `` a faraway land , so the stories all tell / somewhere beyond the horizon . '' It is said that `` troubles there are few '' and that `` maybe it 's something like heaven . ''   Solla Sollew is believed to be a place of hope and wonder , where `` breezes are warm '' and `` people are kind . '' It is a dream of the characters to find this incredible place , where they will find each other and be happy once and for all . However , they can not ever find it , saying in the song `` when I get close , it disappears '' .   References ( edit )       This article does not cite any sources .

It was released as a digital download on 6 January 2017 as one of the double lead singles from his third studio album ÷ ( 2017 ) , along with `` Castle on the Hill '' .   The dancehall - infused pop song was written by Ed Sheeran together with Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid , with additional writing credits given to Kandi Burruss , Tameka `` Tiny '' Cottle , and Kevin `` She'kspere '' Briggs as Sheeran had incorporated an interpolation of the TLC 's song `` No Scrubs '' into `` Shape of You '' . The song was produced by Sheeran and Mac .   `` Shape of You '' peaked at number - one on the singles charts of 44 countries , including the US Billboard Hot 100 ( later becoming the best performing song of 2017 ) , as well as the UK , Australian and Canadian singles charts . It has stayed at number one for a record - tying 16 consecutive weeks on the Canadian Hot 100 , as well as 14 non-consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart , and 12 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 .

On 6 January 2017 , when hosting The Radio 1 Breakfast Show , Sheeran revealed that `` Shape of You '' had originally been written with Rihanna in mind . As he had already written all the songs he wanted for the album , the song was therefore not intended to be included in the album . It was conceived as a duet between Rihanna and Rudimental , but the head of the record label convinced him to keep the song for himself . He said :   `` ( ' Shape of You ' ) is actually a really random one because I went in to write songs for other people with a guy called Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid , and we were writing this song and I was like ' this would really work for Rihanna , ' '' he explained . `` And then I started singing lyrics like ' putting Van The Man on the jukebox ' and I was like ' well she 's not really going to sing that , is she ? ' And then we sort of decided halfway through that we were just going to make it for me . ''   According to Sheeran , Steve Mac started the song - writing session by playing the opening notes of the song on the keyboard . Sheeran then joined in , adding percussion by tapping on the guitar , layering it onto the track . On the writing of the song , he said that he tried to keep the music `` more stripped '' instead of something more elaborate : `` I 'm an acoustic artist , first and foremost . And when I play live , I ca n't replicate these things , I have n't got all the other musicians . '' Sheeran said he wanted an R&B feel to the song , therefore he adjusted the original tune , adding an interpolation of `` No Scrubs '' onto part of the melody . He also revealed that the original lyrics did not end with the words `` the shape of you '' in the chorus , but during the writing of the song , McDaid thought that the lyrics `` I 'm in love with your body '' sounded objectifying , and the lyrics was therefore adjusted .   Promotion ( edit )   On 4 January 2017 , Sheeran uploaded a six - second teaser video of a blue background to social media , with lyrics `` the club is n't the best place to find a lover '' , which is the first line of `` Shape of You '' . To further tease the release , Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds on the song to increase buzz among the general public .   Composition ( edit )   `` Shape of You '' is a pop , dancehall and tropical house song with `` strummy acoustics . '' In the song , Sheeran sings over a marimba - fueled percussive sway about a budding romance . `` The club is n't the best place to find a lover , so the bar is where I go / Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow '' , he sings . `` Come over and start up a conversation with just me / And trust me I 'll give it a chance . '' According to NT News , the song `` tells the story of loved ( or lusted ) up Sheeran meeting a girl in a bar where he and his mates are doing shots . '' `` Shape of You '' is written in the key of C ♯ minor with a tempo of 96 beats per minute . The song is composed in common time ( time ) , and follows a basic chord progression of C ♯ m -- F ♯ m -- A -- B ( i -- iv -- VI -- VII ) , and Sheeran 's vocals span from G ♯ to G ♯ .   The song 's lyrical rhythm drew comparisons to the TLC song `` No Scrubs '' , particularly in the pre-chorus line , `` Boy , let 's not talk too much / Grab on my waist and put that body on me . '' As a result , the composers of `` No Scrubs '' , Kandi Burruss , Tameka `` Tiny '' Cottle , and Kevin `` She'kspere '' Briggs , were awarded co-writing credits on `` Shape of You '' .   Critical reception ( edit )   Jon Caramanica from The New York Times said , `` ' Shape of You ' is trickier , a nimble and effective song that takes the aggressive thinning of ' Caribbean music ' . '' Billboard 's Taylor Weatherby wrote about the song saying , `` ' Shape of You ' does n't quite sound like your typical Sheeran tune . But that almost serves as an indication of what the `` Thinking Out Loud '' singer has been up to during his hiatus : creating music that still feels like Sheeran , just with a new twist . '' Jeremy Gordon of Spin gave the song a positive review , stating that the song `` is a plausible attempt at convincing us he has had sex ... a lot of it . It kind of slaps , though you ca n't really picture Sheeran ever saying ' put that body on me ' to a real human woman . '' News website Metro wrote that it sounds similar to the song `` Cheap Thrills '' by Sia .   Commercial Performance ( edit )   `` Shape of You '' debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 13 January , selling 227,000 combined units in its first week . Sheeran also debuted at number 2 with the song `` Castle on the Hill '' , making him the only artist in UK chart history to debut in the top two positions . `` Shape of You '' debuted at number two on the Scottish Singles Chart behind `` Castle on the Hill '' . The song was certified Silver in the first week due to selling 200,000 units and Gold in the second week selling 400,000 units . The song remained at number one in its second week , selling 139,000 . It has stayed at number one for 13 consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart , and a further week at the top after a week 's interruption by Harry Styles ' `` Sign of the Times '' . In July 2017 , the song reached 184 million in streams , making it the most - streamed song in the UK of all time . It was the nation 's highest selling and most streamed track of 2017 with 787,000 copies sold and 248 million streams throughout the year , to produce a combined sales of 3.2 million .

Language   English     Website   www.thenewatlantis.com     ISSN   1543 - 1215 ( print ) 1555 - 5569 ( web )     OCLC number   56518547     The New Atlantis , founded in 2003 , is a quarterly journal about the social , ethical , political , and policy dimensions of modern science and technology . The journal is published in Washington , D.C. by the social conservative advocacy group the Ethics and Public Policy Center in partnership with the Center for the Study of Technology and Society . It is edited by Ari Schulman , having previously been edited by co-founders Eric Cohen and Adam Keiper .   The journal 's name is taken from Francis Bacon 's utopian novella New Atlantis , which the journal 's editors describe as a `` fable of a society living with the benefits and challenges of advanced science and technology . '' An editorial in the inaugural issue states that the aim of the journal is `` to help us avoid the extremes of euphoria and despair that new technologies too often arouse ; and to help us judge when mobilizing our technological prowess is sensible or necessary , and when the preservation of things that count requires limiting the kinds of technological power that would lessen , cheapen , or ultimately destroy us . '' Writing for National Review , editor Adam Keiper described The New Atlantis as being written from a `` particularly American and conservative way of thinking about both the blessings and the burdens of modern science and technology . '' New Atlantis authors and bioethicists publishing in other journals have also similarly referred to The New Atlantis as being written from a social conservative stance which utilizes religion .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Subjects   2 Book Series   3 Contributors   4 Reception   5 References      Subjects ( edit )   The New Atlantis tends to publish views in favor of technological innovation but wary of certain avenues of development . For example , the journal has generally advocated nuclear energy ; space exploration and development through public - private partnerships , including manned missions to Mars ; biofuels ; and genetically modified foods . But it has expressed ambivalent or critical views about developments in synthetic biology and military technologies like drones , chemical weapons , and cyberwarfare . Articles often explore policy questions on these and other issues , sometimes advocating particular policy outcomes , especially on health care , environmental management , and energy .   The journal has published widely on bioethics , including issues such as stem cell research , assisted reproduction , cloning , assisted suicide , organ and tissue donation , the purported link between vaccines and autism , and informed consent . Articles on these issues often highlight the potential for dangerous or degrading developments , including concerns over human dignity , with many articles examining human enhancement , and life extension , and historical precedents for abuse in eugenics and population control .   The journal also features broader philosophical reflections on science and technology , and tends to be skeptical of what its authors consider to be speculative overreach common in popular discussions . Examples include articles that have defended the existence of free will in light of developments in neuroscience , questioned the wisdom of using brain scans in courtrooms , and described how growing knowledge of epigenetics has undermined common claims about genetic determinism . While the journal has sometimes aired libertarian views about human enhancement and transhumanism , its contributors generally tend to question whether technologies like artificial intelligence , `` friendly '' artificial intelligence , and genetic enhancement are possible or desirable . The journal also publishes the Futurisms blog , dedicated to criticizing transhumanism .   The journal has also published widely on the interpersonal effects of the Internet and digital technology . It has featured articles on subjects like Facebook , cell phones , multitasking , e-readers , GPS and navigation , and virtual reality . A 2006 article by Matthew B. Crawford advocating the intellectual and economic virtues of the manual trades was noted as a best - of - the - year essay by New York Times columnist David Brooks , and was subsequently expanded into the bestselling book Shop Class as Soulcraft . The journal also frequently publishes essays on philosophical and literary questions relating to science and technology .   Book series ( edit )   The New Atlantis also publishes a book series , New Atlantis Books , an imprint of Encounter Books . To date , six books have been released :    In the Shadow of Progress : Being Human in the Age of Technology ISBN 9781594032080 ( 2008 ) , by Eric Cohen   Imagining the Future : Science and American Democracy ISBN 9781594032097 ( 2008 ) , by Yuval Levin   Neither Beast nor God : The Dignity of the Human Person ISBN 9781594032578 ( 2009 ) , by Gilbert Meilaender   Merchants of Despair : Radical Environmentalists , Criminal Pseudo-Scientists , and the Fatal Cult of Antihumanism ISBN 9781594034763 ( 2012 ) , by Robert Zubrin   Why Place Matters : Geography , Identity , and Civic Life in Modern America ISBN 9781594037160 ( 2014 ) , edited by Wilfred M.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( August 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Among the more notable contributors to the journal are physicians and bioethicists such as President 's Council on Bioethics chairman Leon Kass and neuroscientist William B. Hurlbut ; prominent scientists such as Raymond Tallis , Sara Seager , and Marcelo Gleiser ; political scientists , legal and ethical scholars , and policy analysts such as Yuval Levin , Robert P. George , Peter Augustine Lawler , Diana Schaub , Charles T. Rubin , Jeffrey Rosen , Larry Arnhart , and Jonathan B. Tucker ; think - tank scholars such as Nicholas Eberstadt , Roger Bate , Henry Sokolski , and Robert D. Atkinson ; space experts and entrepreneurs such as Mars Society founder Robert Zubrin , James C. Bennett , and Jeff Foust ; and philosophers , historians , authors , and journalists such as Roger Scruton , Gertrude Himmelfarb , Matthew B. Crawford , Harvey Mansfield , Wilfred M. McClay , Ross Douthat , Victor Davis Hanson , Alan Jacobs , Varadaraja V. Raman , Stephen D. Snobelen , Andrew Janiak , William R. Newman , and Ronald Bailey .   Reception ( edit )   Writing for the National Review in a 2003 column , the conservative author Stanley Kurtz described The New Atlantis as influential on thinking about science and technology .   Richard John Neuhaus , late editor of the conservative journal First Things , wrote that The New Atlantis is `` as good a publication as there is for the intelligent exploration of questions in bioethics and projections -- promising , ominous , and fantastical -- about the human future , '' and a writer in The American Conservative described the journal as a source `` of fresh ideas on the Right . '' National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg described The New Atlantis as `` a new and interesting magazine '' that `` seems to be trying to carve out the space for the government to stop the more offensive aspects of biotechnology . ''   By contrast , the liberal bioethicist Jonathan D. Moreno has said that the journal offers `` a very dark vision '' about science and technology , but that it `` makes an important point about the need to worry about the ends as well as means in science '' and that its `` writers were young , smart , and had a good understanding of the political process and the making of public policy . '' Bioethicist Ruth Macklin criticized The New Atlantis as representative of a conservative movement in bioethics that is `` mean - spirited , mystical , and emotional '' and that `` claims insight into ultimate truth yet disavows reason . ''   The journal has particularly gained a reputation among the transhumanist movement for its criticism of human enhancement . James Hughes , a techno - progressivist and at times director of organizations such as the World Transhumanist Association and the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies , notes that the journal `` has published influential attacks on artificial intelligence , nanotechnology , biotechnology , reproductive technology , and life extension . '' Natasha Vita - More has described it as a `` journal known as a ring of bioconservatives bent on opposing the cyberculture , '' while the Extropy Institute has called it `` a high - powered rallying point for the neo-Luddites .

For other uses of `` Wonders of the World '' , see Wonders of the World ( disambiguation ) .   The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ( from left to right , top to bottom ) : Great Pyramid of Giza , Hanging Gardens of Babylon , Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , Statue of Zeus at Olympia , Mausoleum at Halicarnassus ( also known as the Mausoleum of Mausolus ) , Colossus of Rhodes , and the Lighthouse of Alexandria as depicted by 16th - century Dutch artist Maarten van Heemskerck .  Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity to the present day , to catalogue the world 's most spectacular natural wonders and manmade structures .   The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list of the most remarkable creations of classical antiquity ; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in Mesopotamia . The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty , and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently , plus the sun and moon . Many similar lists have been made .

Their writings have not survived , except as references .   The classic seven wonders were :    Colossus of Rhodes   Great Pyramid of Giza   Hanging Gardens of Babylon   Lighthouse of Alexandria   Mausoleum at Halicarnassus   Statue of Zeus at Olympia   Temple of Artemis at Ephesus    The only ancient world wonder that still exists is the Great Pyramid of Giza .   Lists from other eras   In the 19th and early 20th centuries , some writers wrote their own lists with names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages , Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages , Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind , and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages . However , it is unlikely that these lists originated in the Middle Ages , because the word `` medieval '' was not invented until the Enlightenment - era , and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century . Brewer 's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as `` later list ( s ) '' , suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages .   Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Medieval Ages but were well known .   Typically representative are :    Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa   Colosseum   Great Wall of China   Hagia Sophia   Leaning Tower of Pisa   Porcelain Tower of Nanjing   Stonehenge    Other sites sometimes included on such lists :    Cairo Citadel   Cluny Abbey   Ely Cathedral   Taj Mahal        Recent lists   Following in the tradition of the classical list , modern people and organisations have made their own lists of wonderful things ancient and modern . Some of the most notable lists are presented below .   American Society of Civil Engineers   In 1994 , the American Society of Civil Engineers compiled a list of Seven Wonders of the Modern World , paying tribute to the `` greatest civil engineering achievements of the 20th century '' .

USA Today 's New Seven Wonders   In November 2006 the American national newspaper USA Today and the American television show Good Morning America revealed a new list of New Seven Wonders as chosen by six judges . An eighth wonder was chosen on November 24 , 2006 from viewer feedback .

One of the many existing lists was compiled by CNN :    Aurora   Grand Canyon   Great Barrier Reef   Harbor of Rio de Janeiro   Mount Everest   Parícutin volcano   Victoria Falls    New7Wonders of the World   In 2001 an initiative was started by the Swiss corporation New7Wonders Foundation to choose the New7Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments . Twenty - one finalists were announced January 1 , 2006 . Egyptians were not happy that the only surviving original wonder , the Great Pyramid of Giza , would have to compete with the likes of the Statue of Liberty , the Sydney Opera House , and other landmarks , calling the project absurd . In response , Giza was named an honorary Candidate . The results were announced on July 7 , 2007 , in Lisbon , Portugal :     Wonder   Date of construction   Location     Great Wall of China   Since 7th century BC   China     Petra   c. 100 BC   Jordan     Christ the Redeemer   Opened October 12 , 1931   Brazil     Machu Picchu   c .

In 1989 CEDAM brought together a panel of marine scientists , including Dr. Eugenie Clark , to pick underwater areas which they considered to be worthy of protection . The results were announced at The National Aquarium in Washington DC by actor Lloyd Bridges , star of TV 's Sea Hunt :    Palau   Belize Barrier Reef   Great Barrier Reef   Deep - Sea Vents   Galápagos Islands   Lake Baikal   Northern Red Sea    Seven Wonders of the Industrial World   British author Deborah Cadbury wrote Seven Wonders of the Industrial World , a book telling the stories of seven great feats of engineering of the 19th and early 20th centuries . In 2003 , the BBC aired a seven - part docudrama exploring the same feats , with Cadbury as a producer . Each episode dramatised the construction of one of the following industrial wonders :    SS Great Eastern   Bell Rock Lighthouse   Brooklyn Bridge   London sewerage system   First Transcontinental Railroad   Panama Canal   Hoover Dam    Seven Wonders of the World film   Seven Wonders of the World is a 1956 film in which Lowell Thomas searches the world for natural and man made wonders and invites the audience to try to update the ancient Greek Wonders of the World list .   Seven Wonders of the Solar System   In a 1999 article , Astronomy magazine listed the `` Seven Wonders of the Solar System '' . This article was later made into a video .    Enceladus , a moon of Saturn   The Great red spot of Jupiter   The Asteroid belt   The surface of the Sun   The Oceans of Earth   The Rings of Saturn   Olympus Mons on Mars    Other lists of Wonders of the World   Numerous other authors and organisations have composed lists of the wonders of the world . For example :    British biographer , science writer , and novelist Ronald W. Clark published a book of man - made and natural wonders titled Wonders of the World , which lists 52 wonders , one for each week of the year .     Travel writer Howard Hillman published two books on the subject , one with 10 man - made wonders , and one with 10 natural wonders .

'' The Old City is located in East Jerusalem , which is claimed by both the State of Israel and the State of Palestine . The UN and most countries do not recognize Israel 's claim to East Jerusalem , taking the position that the final status of Jerusalem is pending future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .

       "  'document_text_clean': \"Rolling Stone 's 100 Greatest artists of All Time - wikipedia  Rolling Stone 's 100 Greatest artists of All Time   `` The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' is a special issue published by the American magazine Rolling Stone in two parts in 2004 and 2005 , and updated in 2011 . The list presented was compiled based on input from musicians , writers , and industry figures , and is focused on the rock & roll era . It predominantly features American and British musicians .   The publication also features comments written by musicians about their favorite colleagues ( e.g. , Elvis Costello on The Beatles , Janet Jackson on Tina Turner , etc . ) . Since its publication , the list has been frequently cited by many specialized and generalist publications .   Contents    1 Background   2 List statistics   3 See also   4 References   5 External links    Background ( edit )   The list , published in two issues in 2004 and 2005 and updated in 2011 , was based on the choices of a panel of 55 musicians , writers , and industry figures . As the editors explain , the artists were selected by `` their peers '' , and the list aims to be `` a broad survey of rock history '' , spanning from rock and roll , blues , indie rock , rap music and contemporary pop music .   List statistics ( edit )   In both versions of the list , the top three positions are held by The Beatles , Bob Dylan and Elvis Presley .   In 2011 , Rolling Stone published a revised edition of the list , with changes from 27th position onwards . The updated list features artists not present in the original ( including Queen , Metallica , Pink Floyd , Talking Heads , R.E.M. , Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers , and Jay - Z ) , removing a number of other artists ( including Etta James , Miles Davis , Roxy Music , N.W.A. , and Martha & The Vandellas ) .   The list consists primarily of American or British artists , with following exceptions : AC / DC ( Australia ) , Bob Marley ( Jamaica ) , Joni Mitchell ( Canada ) , Lee `` Scratch '' Perry ( Jamaica ; only in the 2005 list ) , Carlos Santana ( Mexico / US ) , U2 ( Ireland ) , and Neil Young ( Canada ) . Tina Turner , who relinquished her American citizenship after obtaining Swiss citizenship in 2013 , was still an American citizen when included in the list .   Most artists on the list were active in the 1960s and 1970s .

       "  'document_text_clean': \"List of Premier League broadcasters - wikipedia  List of Premier League broadcasters  Jump to : navigation , search  This is a list of television broadcasters which provide coverage of the Premier League , English football 's top level competition , which is the most watched league in the world . The main broadcasters in the United Kingdom are Sky Sports , who broadcast 126 of the 168 televised games in the UK , and BT Sport . The BBC shows weekly highlights of the Premier League on its Match of the Day and Match of the Day 2 programmes on Saturdays and Sundays .   The 168 UK televised games are also broadcast across the world ; the remaining 212 matches that are n't broadcast live in the UK are all broadcast elsewhere around the world . English - speaking countries ( excluding the UK ) are able to carry what is known as the ' International feed ' or ' World feed ' audio ; this is full match commentary provided by the Premier League . In Asia , and select other countries around the world , there is also a fully produced studio broadcast where pre , half time and post-match analysis is offered . This is currently hosted by John Dykes .   The 3 : 00pm ( UK time ) Saturday kick - offs are not allowed to be shown live in the UK due to the hours of 2.45 pm - 5.15 pm being ' blocked broadcasting hours ' , as requested by the FA and enforced by UEFA . In Ireland , a different situation applies ; a package of only one Saturday 3 : 00pm kick off each week ( along with one game on the final Sunday ) is sold as an addition to the UK live rights packages , this package is currently held by Sky Sports . While there is no rule prohibiting the screening of the other 3 : 00pm games in Ireland , the Premier League does not make the rights to these games available to Irish broadcasters , due to the overlap in reception that is possible in Northern Ireland and mainland England and not 's total match completely absolute live in total all interviews season the paradox that total matches live other will only be seen on streaming sites of he Premier League TV .

The JDK includes a private JVM and a few other resources to finish the development of a Java Application . Since the introduction of the Java platform , it has been by far the most widely used Software Development Kit ( SDK ) . On 17 November 2006 , Sun announced that they would release it under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) , thus making it free software . This happened in large part on 8 May 2007 , when Sun contributed the source code to the OpenJDK .     Contents  ( hide )   1 JDK contents   2 Ambiguity between a JDK and an SDK   3 Other JDKs   4 See also   5 References   6 External links      JDK contents ( edit )   The JDK has as its primary components a collection of programming tools , including :    appletviewer -- this tool can be used to run and debug Java applets without a web browser   apt -- the annotation - processing tool   extcheck -- a utility that detects JAR file conflicts   idlj -- the IDL - to - Java compiler . This utility generates Java bindings from a given Java IDL file .   jabswitch -- the Java Access Bridge . Exposes assistive technologies on Microsoft Windows systems .   java -- the loader for Java applications . This tool is an interpreter and can interpret the class files generated by the javac compiler . Now a single launcher is used for both development and deployment . The old deployment launcher , jre , no longer comes with Sun JDK , and instead it has been replaced by this new java loader .   javac -- the Java compiler , which converts source code into Java bytecode   javadoc -- the documentation generator , which automatically generates documentation from source code comments   jar -- the archiver , which packages related class libraries into a single JAR file . This tool also helps manage JAR files .   javafxpackager -- tool to package and sign JavaFX applications   jarsigner -- the jar signing and verification tool   javah -- the C header and stub generator , used to write native methods   javap -- the class file disassembler   javaws -- the Java Web Start launcher for JNLP applications   JConsole -- Java Monitoring and Management Console   jdb -- the debugger   jhat -- Java Heap Analysis Tool ( experimental )   jinfo -- This utility gets configuration information from a running Java process or crash dump . ( experimental )   jmap Oracle jmap - Memory Map -- This utility outputs the memory map for Java and can print shared object memory maps or heap memory details of a given process or core dump . ( experimental )   jmc -- Java Mission Control   jps -- Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool lists the instrumented HotSpot Java Virtual Machines ( JVMs ) on the target system . ( experimental )   jrunscript -- Java command - line script shell .   jstack -- utility that prints Java stack traces of Java threads ( experimental )   jstat -- Java Virtual Machine statistics monitoring tool ( experimental )   jstatd -- jstat daemon ( experimental )   keytool -- tool for manipulating the keystore   pack200 -- JAR compression tool   policytool -- the policy creation and management tool , which can determine policy for a Java runtime , specifying which permissions are available for code from various sources .   VisualVM -- visual tool integrating several command - line JDK tools and lightweight performance and memory profiling capabilities   wsimport -- generates portable JAX - WS artifacts for invoking a web service .   xjc -- Part of the Java API for XML Binding ( JAXB ) API . It accepts an XML schema and generates Java classes .    Experimental tools may not be available in future versions of the JDK .   The JDK also comes with a complete Java Runtime Environment , usually called a private runtime , due to the fact that it is separated from the `` regular '' JRE and has extra contents . It consists of a Java Virtual Machine and all of the class libraries present in the production environment , as well as additional libraries only useful to developers , such as the internationalization libraries and the IDL libraries .   Copies of the JDK also include a wide selection of example programs demonstrating the use of almost all portions of the Java API .   Ambiguity between a JDK and an SDK ( edit )   The JDK forms an extended subset of a software development kit ( SDK ) . It includes `` tools for developing , debugging , and monitoring Java applications '' . Oracle strongly suggests to now use the term JDK to refer to the Java SE Development Kit . The Java EE SDK is available with or without the JDK , by which they specifically mean the Java SE 7 JDK .   Other JDKs ( edit )   In addition to the most widely used JDK discussed in this article , there are other JDKs commonly available for a variety of platforms , some of which started from the Sun JDK source and some that did not . All adhere to the basic Java specifications , but often differ in explicitly unspecified areas , such as garbage collection , compilation strategies , and optimization techniques . They include :   In development or in maintenance mode :    Azul Systems Zing , low latency JDK for Linux ;   Azul Systems / OpenJDK - based Zulu for Linux , Windows , Mac OS X , embedded and the cloud ;   OpenJDK / IcedTea ;   GNU 's Classpath and GCJ ( The GNU Compiler for Java ) ;   Aicas JamaicaVM ;   IBM J9 JDK , for AIX , Linux , Windows , MVS , OS / 400 , Pocket PC , z / OS ;    Not being maintained or discontinued :    Apache Harmony   Apple 's Mac OS Runtime for Java JVM / JDK for Classic Mac OS   Blackdown Java -- Port of Sun 's JDK for Linux   Oracle Corporation 's JRockit JDK , for Windows , Linux , and Solaris ;    See also ( edit )    Free software portal   Java portal   Computer programming portal     Classpath ( Java )   Java platform   Java version history    References ( edit )    Jump up ^ `` Java SE 7 Features and Enhancements '' .

Principal photography was completed in Little Rock , Arkansas in December 2017 . It was released in the United States on March 30 , 2018 .

When informed of the decision to shut down the church and to replace it with a building to expand the school , Dave and Jude begin the process of suing the college to save St. James . Things get worse when college student Adam Richertson , a struggling Christian , in protest , tosses a brick into the church , igniting a fire that fatally wounds Jude . Reverend Dave is forced to come to grips with the loss of his dear friend . Adam is horrified by his actions and contemplates whether to confess to the crime , leading him to rediscover his faith in God .   During the lawsuit , Dave seeks the help of his estranged brother , attorney Pearce Hill , who tries to explain to Dave that it is not a case worth fighting for . Dave refuses to listen to his brother 's advice and continues the case into court . After failing to reach a settlement with the college , the trial date is set for the lawsuit . At the same time , Adam sends an anonymous text to Reverend Dave confessing to the church fire and a furious Dave assaults him when confronting him . This severely wounds his lawsuit 's case and leads to Adam being arrested and charged as a felony case .   After seeking God 's help in church through prayer , Reverend Dave eventually realizes that his case has only made things worse and that St. James is not the right church for God and his followers . He drops his lawsuit , reaches an out - of - court settlement with the college , and after talking with a repentant Adam and consulting with Jude 's family , ultimately asks to have the criminal charges against Adam dropped . He then announces to his college protesters that while St. James will be torn down , he will reopen a new church not far from the school for future followers .

Manning as Adam Richertson   Shwayze    Production ( edit )   Principal photography took place in December 2017 around Little Rock , Arkansas .   Reception ( edit )   Box Office ( edit )   In the United States and Canada , God 's Not Dead : A Light in Darkness was released on March 30 , 2018 , alongside Acrimony and Ready Player One , and was projected to gross $4 -- 6 million from 1,685 theaters in its opening weekend . It ended up debuting to just $2.6 million , finishing 12th at the box office and marking the lowest opening of the series . Deadline Hollywood noted the film suffered from being the third film of a trilogy and also said religious audiences saw the film as `` a cash grab and not a movie promoting a Christian message anymore '' , and were more inclined to go to other faith - based films in theaters like I Can Only Imagine and Paul , Apostle of Christ . It fell 58 % in its second weekend to $1.1 million , finishing 17th . By the end of its North American run the film grossed a total of $5.5 million , less than other two films grossed simply in their opening weekends ( $9.7 million and $7.6 million , respectively ) .   Critical response ( edit )   On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 13 % based on 15 reviews , and an average rating of 2.7 / 10 . On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 33 out of 100 , based on 9 critics , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews . '' Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` A -- '' on an A+ to F scale , though as with the second film , Deadline Hollywood noted that `` faith - based films have an easy time gaining an A on CinemaScore '' .

The song was originally written by Charli XCX , whom Icona Pop met several times in London . Swedish producer Patrik Berger sent Charli two beats , and she quickly wrote songs for each of them , one of which became `` I Love It '' and the other of which became her following single `` You 're the One '' . However , she later stated that she knew she would not end up releasing it herself because she could not reconcile it with her sound .   While recording `` Good for You '' with Icona Pop , Berger presented them with Charli 's work on `` I Love It '' . Band member Aino Jawo said she felt a connection to the song because it mirrored her own experiences , and the line `` You 're from the 70s but I 'm a 90s bitch '' reminded her of an older man she had known . Member Caroline Hjelt described Charli XCX 's original demo as `` more cute , in a way ... really cool and cocky '' . Icona Pop approached Swedish producer Style of Eye to make a rougher version of the track , telling him , `` We want the punkiness . We want the ' fuck it ' feeling . ''   Composition ( edit )       `` I Love It '' The song 's chorus features all three singers shouting `` I do n't care / I love it '' in unison .     Problems playing this file ? See media help .         `` I Love It ( Original Demo ) '' The original version of the song before its composition was reworked .     Problems playing this file ? See media help .     `` I Love It '' is set in common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute ( Allegro ) , and is described as an electropop and dance - pop song . It is written in A ♭ major , with an authentic cadence for the main chord progression . Billboard critic Jessica Hopper defined the instrumental by its `` swells of revving synths '' and prominent sub-bass sounds . Pitchfork writer Lindsay Zoladz commented that the song was `` basically just two - and - a-half minutes of drop '' ; colleague Larry Fitzmaurice noted the track 's maximalist approach fit the contemporary trends in electronic and pop music .   The song 's lyrics describe breaking up with an older boyfriend . In its chorus , Icona Pop and Charli XCX shout in unison `` I do n't care / I love it '' . Critics compared the song 's breakup narrative to Kelly Clarkson 's 2004 single `` Since U Been Gone '' , and journalist Chuck Eddy wrote in a piece for Spin that the track 's brattiness was similar to British band Shampoo .   Release and promotion ( edit )   `` I Love It '' was released in Sweden in May 2012 . It entered the Swedish Singles Chart the following month at number 48 , and after two months on the chart , the song peaked at number two for three consecutive weeks . After its January 2013 appearance on an episode of Girls , the song performed better in digital downloads than it had upon initial release . Ten days later it entered the Billboard Hot 100 , eventually climbing to number seven on the chart . Jawo and Hjelt 's first performance with Charli XCX happened in April 2013 , after seeing her back stage at a South by Southwest showcase where both acts were playing .   In June 2013 , several cover versions of the song entered the UK Singles Chart , including one by vlogger Venus Angelic . When Icona Pop released their version , it entered at the top of the chart , overtaking Robin Thicke 's `` Blurred Lines '' featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams .   Critical reception ( edit )   `` I Love It '' was met with positive reviews from music critics . The song placed 15th on The Village Voice 's 2012 Pazz & Jop list , and it rose to eighth place the following year . Pitchfork Media labeled it `` Best New Music '' , calling the song `` delectable , empowering , infinitely repeatable '' . Pitchfork later listed the song number 50 on its `` Top 100 Tracks of 2012 '' list . Rolling Stone placed `` I Love It '' at number 35 on its year - end list , naming it `` the Euro - slut club jam of the summer '' . Amrit Singh for Stereogum described it as `` fun '' , Heather Phares commented Jawo and Hjelt `` half - sung , half - shouted vocals and revved - up synths make the song inescapably catchy '' . Kat Bein of the Miami New Times called the song a `` feminist pop anthem '' .   Music video ( edit )   The music video for `` I Love It '' was directed by Fredrik Etoall . The video was shot in a day by friends of the band while they were in Paris . It shows Jawo and Hjelt playing a show for a crowd shouting the lyrics and dancing , with additional shots from backstage and an after - party . It also includes outdoor shots of them wearing fringed jackets that they made . Charli XCX does not appear in the video .   Track listing ( edit )        Digital download     No .

A court of appeals decides appeals from the district courts within its federal judicial circuit , and in some instances from other designated federal courts and administrative agencies .   The United States courts of appeals are considered among the most powerful and influential courts in the United States . Because of their ability to set legal precedent in regions that cover millions of Americans , the United States courts of appeals have strong policy influence on U.S. law . Moreover , because the U.S. Supreme Court chooses to review fewer than 2 % of the more than 7,000 to 8,000 cases filed with it annually , the U.S. courts of appeals serve as the final arbiter on most federal cases . The Ninth Circuit in particular is very influential , covering 20 % of the American population .   There are currently 179 judgeships on the U.S. courts of appeals authorized by Congress in 28 U.S.C. § 43 pursuant to Article III of the U.S. Constitution . These judges are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate . They have lifetime tenure , earning ( as of 2016 ) an annual salary of $215,400 .   There are thirteen U.S. courts of appeals , although there are other tribunals that have `` Court of Appeals '' in their titles , such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces , which hears appeals in court - martial cases , and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims , which reviews final decisions by the Board of Veterans ' Appeals in the Department of Veterans Affairs . The eleven numbered circuits and the D.C. Circuit are geographically defined . The thirteenth court of appeals is the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , which has nationwide jurisdiction over certain appeals based on their subject matter . All of the courts of appeals also hear appeals from some administrative agency decisions and rulemaking , with by far the largest share of these cases heard by the D.C. Circuit . The Federal Circuit hears appeals from specialized trial courts , primarily the United States Court of International Trade and the United States Court of Federal Claims , as well as appeals from the district courts in patent cases and certain other specialized matters .   Decisions of the U.S. courts of appeals have been published by the private company West Publishing in the Federal Reporter series since the courts were established . Only decisions that the courts designate for publication are included . The `` unpublished '' opinions ( of all but the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits ) are published separately in West 's Federal Appendix , and they are also available in on - line databases like LexisNexis or Westlaw . More recently , court decisions have also been made available electronically on official court websites . However , there are also a few federal court decisions that are classified for national security reasons .   The circuit with the smallest number of appellate judges is the First Circuit , and the one with the largest number of appellate judges is the geographically large and populous Ninth Circuit in the Far West . The number of judges that the U.S. Congress has authorized for each circuit is set forth by law in 28 U.S.C. § 44 , while the places where those judges must regularly sit to hear appeals are prescribed in 28 U.S.C. § 48 .   Although the courts of appeals are frequently called `` circuit courts '' , they should not be confused with the former United States circuit courts , which were active from 1789 to 1911 , during the time when long - distance transportation was much less available , and which were primarily first - level federal trial courts that moved periodically from place to place in `` circuits '' in order to serve the dispersed population in towns and the smaller cities that existed then . The current `` courts of appeals '' system was established in the Judiciary Act of 1891 , also known as the Evarts Act .

Only courts with original jurisdiction hold trials and thus determine punishments ( in criminal cases ) and remedies ( in civil cases ) . Instead , appeals courts review decisions of trial courts for errors of law . Accordingly , an appeals court considers only the record ( that is , the papers the parties filed and the transcripts and any exhibits from any trial ) from the trial court , and the legal arguments of the parties . These arguments , which are presented in written form and can range in length from dozens to hundreds of pages , are known as briefs . Sometimes lawyers are permitted to add to their written briefs with oral arguments before the appeals judges . At such hearings , only the parties ' lawyers speak to the court .   The rules that govern the procedure in the courts of appeals are the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure . In a court of appeals , an appeal is almost always heard by a `` panel '' of three judges who are randomly selected from the available judges ( including senior judges and judges temporarily assigned to the circuit ) . Some cases , however , receive an en banc hearing . Except in the Ninth Circuit Courts , the en banc court consists of all of the circuit judges who are on active status , but it does not include the senior or assigned judges ( except that under some circumstances , a senior judge may participate in an en banc hearing when he or she participated at an earlier stage of the same case ) .   Many decades ago , certain classes of federal court cases held the right of an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States . That is , one of the parties in the case could appeal a decision of a court of appeals to the Supreme Court , and it had to accept the case . The right of automatic appeal for most types of decisions of a court of appeals was ended by an Act of Congress , the Judiciary Act of 1925 . This law was urged by Chief Justice William Howard Taft , and it also reorganized many other things in the federal court system .   The current procedure is that a party in a case may apply to the Supreme Court to review a ruling of the circuit court . This is called petitioning for a writ of certiorari , and the Supreme Court may choose , in its sole discretion , to review any lower court ruling . In extremely rare cases , the Supreme Court may grant the writ of certiorari before the judgment is rendered by the court of appeals , thereby reviewing the lower court 's ruling directly . Certiorari before judgment was granted in the Watergate scandal - related case , United States v. Nixon , and in the 2005 decision involving the Federal Sentencing Guidelines , United States v. Booker .   A court of appeals may also pose questions to the Supreme Court for a ruling in the midst of reviewing a case . This procedure was formerly used somewhat commonly , but now it is quite rare . The Second Circuit , sitting en banc , attempted to use this procedure in the case United States v. Penaranda , as a result of the Supreme Court 's decision in Blakely v. Washington , but the Supreme Court dismissed the question after resolving the same issue in another case , which had come before the Court through the standard procedure . The last instance of the Supreme Court accepting a set of questions and answering them was in a case in 1982 .   A court of appeals may convene a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases directly from the bankruptcy court of its circuit . As of 2008 , only the First , Sixth , Eighth , Ninth , and Tenth Circuits have established a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel . Those circuits that do not have a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel have their bankruptcy appeals heard by the District Court .   Courts of appeals decisions , unlike those of the lower federal courts , establish binding precedents . Other federal courts in that circuit must , from that point forward , follow the appeals court 's guidance in similar cases , regardless of whether the trial judge thinks that the case should be decided differently .   Federal and state laws can and do change from time to time , depending on the actions of Congress and the state legislatures . Therefore , the law that exists at the time of the appeal might be different from the law that existed at the time of the events that are in controversy under civil or criminal law in the case at hand . A court of appeals applies the law as it exists at the time of the appeal ; otherwise , it would be handing down decisions that would be instantly obsolete , and this would be a waste of time and resources , since such decisions could not be cited as precedent . `` ( A ) court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision , unless doing so would result in manifest injustice , or there is statutory direction or some legislative history to the contrary . ''   However , the above rule can not apply in criminal cases if the effect of applying the newer law would be to create an ex post facto law to the detriment of the defendant .   Attorneys ( edit )   In order to serve as counsel in a case appealed to a circuit court the attorney must be admitted to the bar of that circuit . Admission to the bar of a circuit court is granted as a matter of course to any attorney who is admitted to practice law in any state of the United States . The attorney submits an application , pays a fee , and takes the oath of admission . Local practice varies as to whether the oath is given in writing or in open court before a judge of the circuit , and most courts of appeals allow the applicant attorney to choose which method he or she prefers .   Nomenclature ( edit )   When the courts of appeals were created in 1891 , one was created for each of the nine circuits then existing , and each court was named the `` United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit '' . When a court of appeals was created for the District of Columbia in 1893 , it was named the `` Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' , and it was renamed to the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' in 1934 . In 1948 , Congress renamed all of the courts of appeals then existing to their current formal names : the court of appeals for each numbered circuit was named the `` United States Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit '' , and the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' became the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit '' . The Tenth Circuit was created in 1929 by subdividing the existing Eighth Circuit , and the Eleventh Circuit was created in 1981 by subdividing the existing Fifth Circuit . The Federal Circuit was created in 1982 by the merger of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims .   Judicial councils ( edit )  Main article : Judicial council ( United States )  Judicial councils are panels in each circuit that are charged with making `` necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice '' within their circuits . Among their responsibilities is judicial discipline , the formulation of circuit policy , the implementation of policy directives received from the Judicial Conference of the United States , and the annual submission of a report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts on the number and nature of orders entered during the year that relate to judicial misconduct . Judicial councils consist of the chief judge of the circuit and an equal number of circuit judges and district judges of the circuit .

Each circuit court consisted of two Supreme Court justices and the local district judge ; the three circuits existed solely for the purpose of assigning the justices to a group of circuit courts . Some districts ( generally the ones most difficult for an itinerant justice to reach ) did not have a circuit court ; in these districts the district court exercised the original jurisdiction of a circuit court . As new states were admitted to the Union , Congress often did not create circuit courts for them for a number of years .   The Midnight Judges Act reorganized the districts into six circuits , and created circuit judgeships so that Supreme Court justices would no longer have to ride circuit . This Act , however , was repealed in March 1802 , and Congress provided that the former circuit courts would be revived as of July 1 of that year . But it then passed the new Judiciary Act of 1802 in April , so that the revival of the old courts never took effect . The 1802 Act restored circuit riding , but with only one justice to a circuit ; it therefore created six new circuits , but with slightly different compositions than the 1801 Act . These six circuits later were augmented by others . Until 1866 , each new circuit ( except the short - lived California Circuit ) was accompanied by a newly created Supreme Court seat .

This season featured ten All - Star contestants , selected from the show 's second season through to its seventh season , who competed to be inducted into the `` Drag Race Hall of Fame '' .   A new twist was revealed for this season , changing the format of the show . In previous seasons , the bottom two queens had to `` Lip - sync for their Life '' to avoid elimination . This season had the top two performing queens of the challenge `` Lip - sync for their Legacy , '' with the winner of the lip - sync earning $10,000 and choosing which one of the bottom queens gets eliminated . The prizes for the winner were a one - year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $100,000 .   The winner of the second season of RuPaul 's Drag Race All Stars was Alaska , with Detox and Katya being the runners - up .

The President presides over the sessions of the General Assembly .   Miroslav Lajčák of Slovakia has been elected as the United Nations General Assembly President of its 72nd session beginning in September 2017 .

The session of the assembly is scheduled for every year starting in September -- any special , or emergency special , assemblies over the next year will be headed by the President of the UN General Assembly .   The presidency rotates annually between the five geographic groups : African , Asia - Pacific , Eastern European , Latin American and Caribbean , and Western European and other States .   Because of their powerful stature globally , some of the largest , most powerful countries have never held the presidency , such as the People 's Republic of China , France , Japan , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the United States . In particular , it is customary that no permanent member of the United Nations Security Council ever serves as General Assembly president .   The only country that had a national elected as President of the United Nations General Assembly twice is Argentina ; all the other member states had been represented only once by their nationals holding this office . This does not include special and emergency special sessions of the General Assembly .

Count Dracula is an undead , centuries - old vampire , and a Transylvanian nobleman who claims to be a Székely descended from Attila the Hun . He inhabits a decaying castle in the Carpathian Mountains near the Borgo Pass . Unlike the vampires of Eastern European folklore , which are portrayed as repulsive , corpse - like creatures , Dracula wears a veneer of aristocratic charm . In his conversations with Jonathan Harker , he reveals himself as deeply proud of his boyar heritage and nostalgic for the past , which he admits have become only a memory of heroism , honour and valour in modern times .   Early life ( edit )   Details of his early life are obscure , but it is mentioned `` he was in life a most wonderful man . Soldier , statesman , and alchemist ( which was the highest development of the science knowledge of his time ) . He had a mighty brain , a learning beyond compare , and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse ... there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay . '' He studied the black arts at the academy of Scholomance in the Carpathian Mountains , overlooking the town of Sibiu ( also known as Hermannstadt ) and has a deep knowledge of alchemy and magic . Taking up arms , as befitting his rank and status as a voivode , he led troops against the Turks across the Danube . According to his nemesis Abraham Van Helsing , `` He must indeed have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk , over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey - land . If it be so , then was he no common man : for in that time , and for centuries after , he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning , as well as the bravest of the sons of the land beyond the forest . '' Dead and buried in a great tomb in the chapel of his castle , Dracula returns from death as a vampire and lives for several centuries in his castle with three terrifyingly beautiful female vampires beside him .   Narrative ( edit )  Cover of Dracula 's Guest , a collection of short stories authored by Bram Stoker Short story ( edit )  In `` Dracula 's Guest '' , the narrative follows an unnamed Englishman traveller as he wanders around Munich before leaving for Transylvania . It is Walpurgis Night and the young Englishman foolishly leaves his hotel , in spite of the coachman 's warnings , and wanders through a dense forest alone . Along the way , he feels that he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger ( possibly Count Dracula ) .   The short story climaxes in an old graveyard , where the Englishman encounters a sleeping female vampire called Countess Dolingen in a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven into it . This malevolent and beautiful vampire awakens from her marble bier to conjure a snowstorm before being struck by lightning and returning to her eternal prison . However , the Englishman 's troubles are not quite over , as he is dragged away by an unseen force and rendered unconscious . He awakens to find a `` gigantic '' wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat ; however , the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives . When the Englishman is finally taken back to his hotel , a telegram awaits him from his expectant host Dracula , with a warning about `` dangers from snow and wolves and night '' .  Novel ( edit )  As the Dracula novel begins in the late 19th century , Dracula acts on a long - contemplated plan for world domination , and infiltrates London to begin his reign of terror . He summons Jonathan Harker , a newly qualified English solicitor , to provide legal support for a real estate transaction overseen by Harker 's employer . Dracula at first charms Harker with his cordiality and historical knowledge , and even rescues him from the clutches of the three female vampires in the castle . In truth , however , Dracula merely wishes to keep Harker alive long enough to complete the legal transaction and to learn as much as possible about England .   Dracula leaves his castle and boards a Russian ship , the Demeter , taking along with him 50 boxes of Transylvanian soil , which he needs in order to regain his strength and rest during daylight . During the voyage to Whitby , a coastal town in northern England , he sustains himself on the ship 's crew members . Only one body is later found , that of the captain , who is found tied up to the ship 's helm . The captain 's log is recovered and tells of strange events that had taken place during the ship 's journey . Dracula leaves the ship in the form of a dog .   Soon the Count is menacing Harker 's fiancée , Wilhelmina `` Mina '' Murray , and her friend , Lucy Westenra . There is also a notable link between Dracula and Renfield , a patient in an insane asylum overseen by John Seward , who is compelled to consume insects , spiders , birds , and other creatures -- in ascending order of size -- in order to absorb their `` life force '' . Renfield acts as a kind of sensor , reacting to Dracula 's proximity and supplying clues accordingly . Dracula begins to visit Lucy 's bed chamber on a nightly basis , draining her of blood while simultaneously infecting her with the curse of vampirism . Not knowing the cause for Lucy 's deterioration , her three suitors - Seward , Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris - call upon Seward 's mentor , the Dutch doctor Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing soon deduces her condition 's supernatural origins , but does not speak out . Despite an attempt at keeping the vampire at bay with garlic , Dracula attacks Lucy 's house one final time , killing her mother and transforming Lucy herself into one of the undead .   Harker escapes Dracula 's castle and returns to England , barely alive and deeply traumatized . On Seward 's suggestion , Mina seeks Van Helsing 's assistance in assessing Harker 's health . She reads his journal and passes it along to Van Helsing . This unfolds the first clue to the identity of Lucy 's assailant , which later prompts Mina to collect all of the events of Dracula 's appearance in news articles , saved letters , newspaper clippings and the journals of each member of the group . This assists the group in investigating Dracula 's movements and later discovering that Renfield 's behaviour is directly influenced by Dracula . They then discover that Dracula has purchased a residence just next door to Seward 's . The group gathers intelligence to track the location of Dracula for the purpose of destroying him .  Max Schreck as Count Orlok , the first confirmed cinematic representation of Dracula ( in Nosferatu , 1922 ) .  After the undead Lucy attacks several children , Van Helsing , Seward , Holmwood and Morris enter her crypt and destroy her to save her soul . Later , Harker joins them and the party work to discover Dracula 's intentions . Harker aids the party in tracking down the locations of the boxes to the various residences of Dracula and discovers that Dracula purchased multiple real estate properties ' over the counter ' throughout the North , South , East and West sides of London under the alias ' Count De Ville ' . Dracula 's main plan was to move each of his 50 boxes of earth to his various properties in order to arrange multiple lairs throughout and around the perimeter of London .   The party pries open each of the graves , places wafers of Sacramental bread within each of them , and seals them shut . This deprives the Count of his ability to seek safety in those boxes . Dracula gains entry into Seward 's residence by coercing an invitation out of Renfield . As he attempts to enter the room in which Harker and Mina are staying , Renfield tries to stop him ; Dracula then mortally wounds him . With his dying breath , Renfield tells Seward and Van Helsing that Dracula is after Mina. Van Helsing and Seward discover Dracula biting Mina then forcing her to drink his blood . The group repel Dracula using crucifixes and sacramental bread , forcing Dracula to flee by turning into a dark vapor . The party continue to hunt Dracula to search for his remaining lairs . Although Dracula 's ' baptism ' of Mina grants him a telepathic link to her , it backfires when Van Helsing hypnotizes Mina and uses her supernatural link with Dracula to track him as he flees back to Transylvania .   The heroes follow Dracula back to Transylvania , and in a climactic battle with Dracula 's gypsy bodyguards , finally destroy him . Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart to kill him , Mina 's narrative describes his decapitation by Harker 's kukri while Morris simultaneously pierced his heart with a Bowie knife ( Mina Harker 's Journal , 6 November , Dracula Chapter 27 ) . His body then turns into dust , but not before Mina sees an expression of peace on his face .   Characteristics ( edit )   Although early in the novel Dracula dons a mask of cordiality , he often flies into fits of rage when his plans are frustrated . When the three vampire women who live in his castle attempt to seduce Jonathan Harker , Dracula physically assaults one and ferociously berates them for their insubordination . He then relents and talks to them more kindly , telling them that he does indeed love each of them .   He has an appreciation for ancient architecture , and when purchasing a home he prefers them to be aged , saying `` A new home would kill me '' , and that to make a new home habitable to him would take a century .   Dracula is very proud of his warrior heritage , proclaiming his pride to Harker on how the Székely people are infused with the blood of heroes . He also expresses an interest in the history of the British Empire , speaking admiringly of its people . He has a somewhat primal and predatory worldview ; he pities ordinary humans for their revulsion to their darker impulses . He is not without human emotions , however ; he often says that he too can love .   Though usually portrayed as having a strong Eastern European accent , the original novel only specifies that his spoken English is excellent , though strangely toned .   His appearance varies in age . He is described early in the novel as thin , with a long white mustache , pointed ears and sharp teeth . It is also noted later in the novel ( Chapter 11 subsection `` The Escaped Wolf '' ) by a zookeeper who sees him that he has a hooked nose and a pointed beard with a streak of white in it . He is dressed all in black and has hair on his palms . Jonathan Harker described him as an old man , `` cruel looking '' and giving an effect of `` extraordinary pallor '' . When angered , the Count showed his true bestial nature , his blue eyes flaming red .   I saw ... Count Dracula ... with red light of triumph in his eyes , and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of .  -- Jonathan Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 4  As the novel progresses , Dracula is described as taking on a more and more youthful appearance . After Harker strikes him with a shovel , he is left with a scar on his forehead which he bears throughout the course of the novel .   Dracula also possesses great wealth and having Romani people in his homeland who are loyal to him as servants and protectors .   Powers and weaknesses ( edit )   Count Dracula is portrayed in the novel using many different supernatural abilities , and is believed to have gained his abilities through dealings with the Devil . Chapter 18 of the novel describes many of the abilities , limitations and weaknesses of Dracula and vampires in particular . Dracula has superhuman strength which , according to Van Helsing , is equivalent to that of 20 strong men . He does not cast a shadow or have a reflection from mirrors . He is immune to conventional means of attack ; a sailor tries to stab him in the back with a knife , but the blade goes through his body as though it is air . Why Harker 's and Morris ' physical attacks are able to harm him in other parts of the book is never explained although it is noteworthy that the failed stabbing by the sailor occurred at night and the successful attacks were during daylight hours . The Count can defy gravity to a certain extent and possesses superhuman agility , able to climb vertical surfaces upside down in a reptilian manner . He can travel onto `` unhallowed '' ground such as the graves of suicides and those of his victims . He has powerful hypnotic , telepathic and illusionary abilities . He also has the ability to `` within limitations '' vanish and reappear elsewhere at will . If he knows the path , he can come out from anything or into anything regardless of how close it is bound even if it is fused with fire .   He has amassed cunning and wisdom throughout centuries , and he is unable to die by the mere passing of time alone .   He can command animals such as rats , owls , bats , moths , foxes and wolves . However , his control over these animals is limited , as seen when the party first enters his house in London . Although Dracula is able to summon thousands of rats to swarm and attack the group , Seward summons a pack of hounds to devour the rats . The rats are so frightened of the dogs that they flee , and any control which Dracula had over them is gone .   Dracula can also manipulate the weather and , within his range , is able to direct the elements , such as storms , fog and mist .   Shapeshifting ( edit )   Dracula can shapeshift at will , able to grow and become small , his featured forms in the novel being that of a bat , a wolf , a large dog and a fog or mist . When the moonlight is shining , he can travel as elemental dust within its rays . He is able to pass through tiny cracks or crevices while retaining his human form or in the form of a vapour ; described by Van Helsing as the ability to slip through a hairbreadth space of a tomb door or coffin . This is also an ability used by his victim Lucy as a vampire . When the party breaks into her tomb , they dismantle the secured coffin to find it completely empty ; her corpse being no longer located within .   Vampirism ( edit )   One of Dracula 's most mysterious powers is the ability to turn others into vampires by biting them . According to Van Helsing :   When they become such , there comes with the change the curse of immortality ; they can not die , but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world . For all that die from the preying of the Un-dead become themselves Un-dead , and prey on their kind . And so the circle goes on ever widening , like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water . Friend Arthur , if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die , or again , last night when you open your arms to her , you would in time , when you had died , have become nosferatu , as they call it in Eastern europe , and would for all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have filled us with horror .  -- Dr. Seward 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 16  The vampire bite itself does not cause death . It is the method vampires use to drain blood of the victim and to increase their influence over them . This is described by Van Helsing :   The Nosferatu do not die like the bees when they sting once . He is only stronger , and being stronger , have yet more power to work evil .  -- Mina Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 18  Victims who are bitten by a vampire and do not die , are hypnotically influenced by them :   Those children whose blood she suck are not yet so much worse ; but if she live on , Un-Dead , more and more lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her .  -- Mina Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 18  Van Helsing later describes the aftermath of a bitten victim when the vampire has been killed :   But if she die in truth , then all cease ; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear , and they go back to their plays unknowing of whatever has been .  -- Mina Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 18  As Dracula slowly drains Lucy 's blood , she dies from acute blood loss and later transforms into a vampire , despite the efforts of Seward and Van Helsing to provide her with blood transfusions .   He is aided by powers of necromancy and divination of the dead , that all who die by his hand may reanimate and do his bidding .  Bloodletting ( edit )  Dracula requires no other sustenance but fresh human blood , which has the effect of rejuvenating him and allowing him to grow younger . His power is drawn from the blood of others , and he can not survive without it . Although drinking blood can rejuvenate his youth and strength , it does not give him the ability to regenerate ; months after being struck on the head by a shovel , he still bears a scar from the impact .   Dracula 's preferred victims are women . Harker states that he believes Dracula has a state of fasting as well as a state of feeding . Dracula does state to Mina however that exerting his abilities caused a desire to feed .  Vampire 's baptism of blood ( edit )  Count Dracula is depicted as the `` King Vampire '' , and can control other vampires . To punish Mina and the party for their efforts against him , Dracula bites her on at least three occasions . He also forces her to drink his blood ; this act curses her with the effects of vampirism and gives him a telepathic link to her thoughts . However , hypnotism was only able to be done before dawn . Van Helsing refers to the act of drinking blood by both the vampire and the victim `` the Vampire 's Baptism of Blood '' .     ``   you , their best beloved one , are now to me , flesh of my flesh , blood of my blood , kin of my kin , my bountiful wine - press for a while , and shall be later on my companion and my helper . You shall be avenged in turn , for not one of them but shall minister to your needs . But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done . You have aided in thwarting me . Now you shall come to my call . When my brain says ' Come ! ' to you , you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding .   ''     The effects changes Mina ' physically and mentally over time . A few moments after Dracula attacks her , Van Helsing takes a wafer of sacramental bread and places it on her forehead to bless her ; when the bread touches her skin , it burns her and leaves a scar on her forehead . Her teeth start growing longer but do not grow sharper . She begins to lose her appetite , feeling repulsed by normal food , begins to sleep more and more during the day ; can not wake unless at sunset and stops writing in her diary . When Van Helsing later crumbles the same bread in a circle around her , she is unable to cross or leave the circle , discovering a new form of protection .   Dracula 's death can release the curse on any living victim of eventual transformation into vampire . However , Van Helsing reveals that were he to successfully escape , his continued existence would ensure that even if he did not victimize Mina further , she would transform into a vampire upon her eventual natural death .   Limitations of his powers ( edit )   Dracula is much less powerful in daylight and is only able to shift his form at dawn , noon , and dusk ( he can shift his form freely at night or if he is at his grave ) . The sun is not fatal to him , as sunlight does not burn and destroy him upon contact , though most of his abilities cease .   The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course . Until it sets to - night , that monster must retain whatever form he now has . He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope . He can not melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies . If he go through a doorway , he must open the door like a mortal .  -- Johnathan Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 22  His power ceases , as does that all of all evil things , at the coming of the day . Only at certain times can he have limited freedom . If he be not at the place whither he is bound , he can only change himself at noon or exact sunrise or sunset .  -- Mina Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 18  He is also limited in his ability to travel , as he can only cross running water at low or high tide . Due to this , he is unable to fly across a river in the form of a bat or mist or even by himself board a boat or step off a boat onto a dock unless he is physically carried over with assistance . He is also unable to enter a place unless invited to do so by someone of the household , even a visitor ; once invited , he can enter and leave the premises at will .   Weaknesses ( edit )  Thirst ( edit )  Dracula has a bloodlust which he is seemingly unable to control . At the sight of blood he becomes enveloped in a demonic fury which is fueled by the need to feed . Other adaptations call this uncontrollable state ' the thirst ' .  Religious symbolism ( edit )  There are items which afflict him to the point he has no power and can even calm him from his insatiable appetite for blood . He is repulsed by garlic , as well as sacred items and symbols such as crucifixes , and sacramental bread .   at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little , and the blood was trickling over my chin . I laid down the razor , turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster . When the Count saw my face , his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury , and he suddenly made a grab at my throat . I drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix . It made an instant change in him , for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there .  -- Jonathan Harker 's journal , Dracula , Chapter 2  Placing the branch of a wild rose upon the top of his coffin will render him unable to escape it ; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin could kill him so that he remain true - dead .   Mountain Ash is also described as a form of protection from a vampire although the effects are unknown . This was believed to be used as protection against evil spirits and witches during the Victorian era .  Death - sleep ( edit )  The state of rest to which vampires are prone to during times of day is described in the novel as a deathlike sleep where the vampire sleeps open - eyed , is unable to awaken or move , yet also may be unaware of any presence of individuals who may be trespassing . Dracula is portrayed as being active in daylight at least once in order to pursue a victim . Dracula also purchases many properties throughout London ' over the counter ' which shows that he does have the ability to have some type of presence in daylight .     ``   on a pile of newly dug earth , lay the Count ! He was either dead or asleep . I could not say which , for eyes were open and stony , but without the glassiness of death , and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor . The lips were as red as ever . But there was no sign of movement , no pulse , no breath , no beating of the heart . I bent over him , and tried to find any sign of life , but in vain ... I thought he might have the keys on him , but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes , and in them dead though they were , such a look of hate , though unconscious of me or my presence , that I fled from the place , and leaving the Count 's room by the window   ''     He requires Transylvanian soil to be nearby to him in a foreign land or to be entombed within his coffin within Transylvania in order to successfully rest ; otherwise , he will be unable to recover his strength . This has forced him to transport many boxes of Transylvanian earth to each of his residences in London . It should be noted however that he is most powerful when he is within his Earth - Home , Coffin - Home , Hell - Home , or any place unhallowed .   Further , if Dracula or any vampire has had their fill in blood upon feeding , they will be caused to rest in this dead state even longer than usual .   Other abilities ( edit )   While universally feared by the local people of Transylvania and even beyond , Dracula commands the loyalty of gypsies and a band of Slovaks who transport his boxes on their way to London and to serve as an armed convoy bringing his coffin back to his castle . The Slovaks and gypsies appear to know his true nature , for they laugh at Harker when he tries to communicate his plight , and betray Harker 's attempt to send a letter through them by giving it to the Count .   Dracula seems to be able to hold influence over people with mental disorders , such as Renfield , who is never bitten but who worships Dracula , referring to him over the course of the novel as `` Master '' and `` Lord '' . Dracula also afflicts Lucy with chronic sleepwalking , putting her into a trance - like state that allows them not only to submit to his will but also seek him and satisfy his need to feed .   Dracula 's powers and weaknesses vary greatly in the many adaptations . Previous and subsequent vampires from different legends have had similar vampire characteristics .   Character development subsequent to the novel ( edit )  Main article : Dracula in popular culture Statue of Béla Lugosi as Count Dracula , at the Hollywood Wax Museum  Dracula is one of the most famous characters in popular culture . He has been portrayed by more actors in more visual media adaptations of the novel than any other horror character . Actors who have played him include Max Schreck , Béla Lugosi , John Carradine , Christopher Lee , Francis Lederer , Denholm Elliott , Jack Palance , Louis Jourdan , Frank Langella , Klaus Kinski , Gary Oldman , Leslie Nielsen , George Hamilton , Keith - Lee Castle , Gerard Butler , Duncan Regehr , Richard Roxburgh , Marc Warren , Rutger Hauer , Stephen Billington , Thomas Kretschmann , Dominic Purcell , Luke Evans and Lon Chaney Jr ... In 2003 , Count Dracula , as portrayed by Lugosi in the 1931 film , was named as the 33rd greatest movie villain by the AFI .  Gary Oldman as Dracula in Bram Stoker 's Dracula .  The character is closely associated with the western cultural archetype of the vampire , and remains a popular Halloween costume .    Count Dracula appears in Mad Monster Party ? voiced by Allen Swift . This version is shown to be wearing a monocle . Count Dracula is among the monsters that Baron Boris von Frankenstein invites to the Isle of Evil in order to show off the secret of total destruction and announce his retirement from the Worldwide Organization of Monsters .   In Sesame Street , there is a character called Count von Count who was based on Bela Lugosi 's interpretation of Count Dracula and Jack Davis ' design for Dracula from Mad Monster Party ? .   Count Dracula appears in Mad Mad Mad Monsters ( a `` prequel of sorts '' to Mad Monster Party ? ) voiced again by Allen Swift . He and his son are invited by Baron Henry von Frankenstein to attend the wedding of Frankenstein 's Monster and its mate at the Transylvania Astoria Hotel .   Dracula is the primary antagonist of the Castlevania video game series and the main protagonist of the Lords of Shadow reboot series .   Dracula appears as the lead character of Dracula the Un-dead , a novel by Stoker 's great - grand nephew Dacre presented as a sequel to the original .   Count Dracula is the main character of the Hotel Transylvania franchise , voiced by Adam Sandler .    Modern and postmodern analyses of the character ( edit )  Portrait of Vlad III Dracula .  Already in 1958 , Cecil Kirtly proposed that Count Dracula shared his personal past with the historical Transylvanian - born Voivode Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia , also known as Vlad the Impaler or Vlad Țepeș . Following the publication of In Search of Dracula by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally in 1972 , this supposed connection attracted much popular attention . This work argued that Bram Stoker based his Dracula on Vlad the Impaler .   Historically , the name `` Dracula '' is the given name of Vlad Țepeș ' family , a name derived from a secret fraternal order of knights called the Order of the Dragon , founded by Sigismund of Luxembourg ( king of Hungary and Bohemia , and Holy Roman Emperor ) to uphold Christianity and defend the Empire against the Ottoman Turks . Vlad II Dracul , father of Vlad III , was admitted to the order around 1431 because of his bravery in fighting the Turks and was dubbed Dracul ( Dragon ) thus his son became Dracula ( son of the dragon ) . From 1431 onward , Vlad II wore the emblem of the order and later , as ruler of Wallachia , his coinage bore the dragon symbol .   Stoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on Romanian history , and chose this to replace the name ( Count Wampyr ) that he had originally intended to use for his villain . However , some Dracula scholars , led by Elizabeth Miller , have questioned the depth of this connection as early as 1998 . They argue that Stoker in fact knew little of the historic Vlad III , Vlad the Impaler and that he used only the name `` Dracula '' and some miscellaneous scraps of Romanian history . As well , and there are no comments about Vlad III in the author 's working notes .   While having a conversation with Jonathan Harker in Chapter 3 , Dracula refers to his own background , and these speeches show elements which Stoker directly copied from Wilkinson 's book . Stoker mentions the Voivode of the Dracula race who fought against the Turks after the defeat in the Battle of Kosovo , and was later betrayed by his brother , historical facts which unequivocally point to Vlad III , described as `` Voïvode Dracula '' by Wilkinson :   Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground ? This was a Dracula indeed ! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother , when he had fallen , sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them ! Was it not this Dracula , indeed , who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey - land ; who , when he was beaten back , came again , and again , though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered , since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph ! ( Chapter 3 , pp. 19 )   The Count 's intended identity is later commented by Professor Van Helsing , referring to a letter from his friend Arminius :   He must , indeed , have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk , over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey - land . ( Chapter 18 , pp. 145 )   This indeed encourages the reader to identify the Count with the Voivode Dracula first mentioned by him in Chapter 3 , the one betrayed by his brother : Vlad III Dracula , betrayed by his brother Radu the Handsome , who had chosen the side of the Turks . But as noted by the Dutch author Hans Corneel de Roos , in Chapter 25 , Van Helsing and Mina drop this rudimentary connection to Vlad III and instead describe the Count 's personal past as that of `` that other of his race '' who lived `` in a later age '' . By smoothly exchanging Vlad III for a nameless double , Stoker avoided that his main character could be unambiguously linked to a historical person traceable in any history book .   Similarly , the novelist did not want to disclose the precise site of the Count 's residence , Castle Dracula . As confirmed by Stoker 's own handwritten research notes , the novelist had a specific location for the Castle in mind while writing the narrative : an empty mountain top in the Transylvanian Kelemen Alps near the former border with Moldavia . Efforts to promote the Poenari Castle ( ca . 200 km away from the novel 's place of action near the Borgo Pass ) as the `` real Castle Dracula '' have no basis in Stoker 's writing ; Stoker did not know this building . Regarding the Bran Castle near Brașov , Stoker possibly saw an illustration of Castle Bran ( Törzburg ) in Charles Boner 's book on Transylvania . Although Stoker may have been inspired by its romantic appearance , neither Boner , nor Mazuchelli nor Crosse ( who also mention Terzburg or Törzburg ) associate it with Vlad III ; for the site of his fictitious Castle Dracula , Stoker preferred an empty mountain top .   Furthermore , Stoker 's detailed notes reveal that the novelist was very well aware of the ethnic and geo - political differences between the `` Roumanians '' or `` Wallachs '' / `` Wallachians '' , descendants of the Dacians , and the Székelys or Szeklers , allies of the Magyars or Hungarians , whose interests were opposed to that of the Wallachians . In the novel 's original typewritten manuscript , the Count speaks of throwing off the `` Austrian yoke '' , which corresponds to the Szekler political point of view . This expression is crossed out , however , and replaced by `` Hungarian yoke '' ( as appearing in the printed version ) , which matches the historical perspective of the Wallachians . This has been interpreted by some to mean that Stoker opted for the Wallachian , not the Szekler interpretation , thus lending more consistency to the Romanian identity of his Count : although not identical with Vlad III , the Vampire is portrayed as one of the `` Dracula race '' .

Originally meant to be a temporary character , Andy was so likable that producers asked Pratt back as a series regular . He appears in the first season as Ann Perkins ' unemployed slacker boyfriend , then takes a job as a shoe - shiner at Pawnee City Hall in the second season . Andy eventually marries April Ludgate and is later promoted to Leslie Knope 's assistant . Pratt was credited as a guest star for the first season , despite appearing in every episode ; he is part of the main cast for every season after season one .   Andy is one of the few starring characters not to appear in every episode , as he was absent for a multi-episode arc in season six while Pratt was filming Guardians of the Galaxy .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Background   2 Storyline   2.1 Season one   2.2 Season two   2.3 Season three   2.4 Season four   2.5 Season five   2.6 Season six   2.7 Season seven     3 Development   4 Controversy   5 References      Background ( edit )   At the start of the series , Andy Dwyer is dating Ann Perkins . Ann matured faster than Andy did ; while Ann entered into a career in nursing , Andy remained lazy and spoiled .   Andy remained unemployed after school but was the lead singer and guitarist for his rock band , which underwent numerous name changes ( starting with `` Teddy Bear Suicide '' prior to the show 's first season ) , including `` MouseRat , '' `` God Hates Figs , '' `` Department of Homeland Obscurity , '' `` Flames For Flames , '' `` Muscle Confusion , '' `` Nothing Rhymes With Orange '' ( then , `` Everything Rhymes With Orange '' ) , `` Punch Face Champions , '' `` Rad Wagon , '' `` Puppy Pendulum , '' `` Possum Pendulum , '' `` Penis Pendulum , '' `` Handrail Suicide , '' `` Angel Snack , '' `` Just The Tip , '' `` Jet - Black Pope , '' `` Four - Skin '' ( later `` Three - Skin '' when one member quit ) , `` MouseRat '' ( again ) , `` RatMouse '' ( without Dwyer ) , `` Scarecrow Boat , '' `` Tackleshaft '' and then `` MouseRat '' ( yet again ) .   Though absentminded and possessing an extremely short attention span , Andy is shown to have a savant - like memory . For instance , he received the highest grade the police academy had ever seen on the written entrance test , has an uncanny ability to remember movies word for word , and is able to memorize a long list of facts for his feminist college class in the episode , `` Smallest Park . '' Andy also had perfect SAT scores , but mentioned it was probably due to broken Scantron machines .   Storyline ( edit )   Season one ( edit )   Before the start of the first season , a drunken Andy fell into a large construction pit and broke both his legs while attempting to retrieve a discarded toaster from the bottom of the pit . Ann is at first unaware that Andy was drunk at the time of the fall , and the incident inspires her to attend Parks and Recreation meetings to advocate for filling in the pit . It is at these meetings that Ann first befriends Parks Deputy Director Leslie Knope .   With both of Andy 's legs in casts , Ann pampers him , bringing him food and letting him play video games all day . When the doctors inform Andy that the casts can be removed , he delays their removal for several weeks so he can continue receiving this treatment from Ann . After the casts are removed , Ann discovers the truth and furiously breaks up with Andy .   Season two ( edit )   Andy moves into a tent pitched in the pit and watches Ann , claiming to be protecting her . He makes many failed attempts to reconcile with Ann . After Mark Brendanawicz begins dating Ann , Andy grows to hate him , but pretends to like him whenever Ann is around . Andy is injured in the pit a second time when Leslie arranges to have it filled with dirt , unaware that Andy is still in the pit . Andy considers suing the town with the hopes of getting money and winning Ann back , but Leslie convinces him to settle out of court in exchange for having the pit filled in . Leslie gives Andy a job as the shoe - shiner at the Pawnee City Hall as part of his settlement . April Ludgate , the parks department intern , begins to develop a crush on Andy , but he is for a long time unaware of her feelings toward him . As time goes on , Andy begins to develop feelings for April , though he is unsure about dating her due to their age difference and his own unresolved feelings for Ann . Simultaneously , Ann begins to show similar feelings for Andy after her relationship with Mark ends . At the end of the season , having broken up with Mark , Ann kisses Andy , who does not reciprocate . This later causes him problems with April , who continues to believe he is still in love with Ann .   Season Three ( edit )   Andy has been unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with April . When she finally returns from Venezuela , she arrives with a new boyfriend , Eduardo . Leslie encourages Andy to not give up . In the episode `` Time Capsule '' , Andy befriends Eduardo at the advice of Chris Traeger . As a result , April begins hating her new boyfriend , and he moves back to Venezuela . Andy also becomes the new coach of one of the two youth basketball teams , with Ron serving as the other coach . Andy 's coaching style is much lazier than Ron 's strict style . He is also briefly Ron 's receptionist in `` Flu Season '' . In the episode `` Media Blitz '' , April leads Andy to believe that if he completes the tasks she hates every day for a month , she will consider being with him . Although she begins this as a bluff , after seeing Andy complete even the most humiliating of these tasks happily , she kisses him . In the episode `` Andy and April 's Fancy Party '' Andy reveals that he had proposed to April a day earlier after only one month of dating to which April replied , `` Fine . '' They are married at the end of the episode in a surprise ceremony .   Season four ( edit )   At the beginning of season four , Tom asks Andy to join his new company . He declines Tom 's offer and instead joins Leslie 's campaign as her assistant and head of security , a role he enjoys very much . At the end of the season , he is encouraged by April to pursue a career as a police officer as all his `` dream jobs , '' with the exception of rock star , revolve around law enforcement .   Season five ( edit )   During the fifth season , Andy continues to pursue his ambition to become a police officer and seeks help from others to better his chances of passing the police academy entrance exams . He asks Chris to help him get fit enough to pass the police physical . His marriage to April is not strained by the distance between them : they exchange care packages and he visits her in Washington , DC .   Andy earns a perfect score on the written portion of the police officers ' exam . When he fails the personality portion of the exam , he gets a rousing pep talk from Chris . Ben then gives Andy a job working with him at the Sweetum 's charity foundation .   Season six ( edit )   Andy 's role is reduced in the sixth season , as Chris Pratt was busy with other filming commitments . Andy spends the early part of season 6 in England attending to Sweetum 's charity work . Before he went to England , he loses 50 pounds after giving up beer . He briefly visits Pawnee and does not want to return to England , but April convinces him to go back . In the season finale , Andy reunites with MouseRat and sings a Li'l Sebastian memorial song at the Pawnee Unity concert .   Season seven ( edit )   Andy remains married to April Ludgate , and the two have become responsible adults , to their horror . He has a TV show on public access , The Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show , where he is knighted by Lord Edgar Covington in its final episode , and later works part - time at the National Parks service . His friendship with Tom has grown since the previous seasons . After April decides to leave for a new job in Washington , D.C. , Andy goes with her .   In a series of flash - forwards in the final episode , April and Andy ask Leslie and Ben for advice regarding the prospect of having children , which Andy very much wants but April does not . They decide to try for it and their son , Burt Snakehole Ludgate Karate Dracula Macklin Demon Jack - o - Lantern `` Jack '' Dwyer is born on Halloween 2023 . By 2025 the couple is expecting their second child .   Development ( edit )   Chris Pratt was credited as a guest star throughout the entire first season , but was promoted to the main cast in the second season . The Andy character was originally supposed to appear only in the first season , but the producers liked Pratt so much that almost immediately after casting him , they decided to make Andy a regular character .   Controversy ( edit )   In the second season , Pratt did a scene with Amy Poehler while he was naked . Poehler was not expecting this and Pratt was reprimanded for it . The take was later aired on TV . He was expected to wear skin tone briefs .

As a partial solar eclipse , it was visible on land from Nunavut in northern Canada to as far south as northern South America . In northwestern Europe and Africa , it was partially visible in the late evening . In Asia , it was visible only at the eastern extremity , the Chukchi Peninsula .  Play media Video of the eclipse second contact in Simpsonville , South Carolina . Crowd reaction is heard on audio .  Prior to this event , no solar eclipse had been visible across the entire contiguous United States since June 8 , 1918 ; not since the February 1979 eclipse had a total eclipse been visible from anywhere in the mainland United States . The path of totality touched 14 states , and the rest of the U.S. had a partial eclipse . The area of the path of totality was about 16 percent of the area of the United States , with most of this area over the ocean , not land . The event 's shadow began to cover land on the Oregon coast as a partial eclipse at 4 : 05 p.m. UTC ( 9 : 05 a.m. PDT ) , with the total eclipse beginning there at 5 : 16 p.m. UTC ( 10 : 16 a.m. PDT ) ; the total eclipse 's land coverage ended along the South Carolina coast at about 6 : 44 p.m. UTC ( 2 : 44 p.m. EDT ) . Visibility as a partial eclipse in Honolulu , Hawaii began with sunrise at 4 : 20 p.m. UTC ( 6 : 20 a.m. HST ) and ended by 5 : 25 p.m. UTC ( 7 : 25 a.m. HST ) .   This total solar eclipse marked the first such event in the smartphone and social media era in America . Information , personal communication , and photography were widely available as never before , capturing popular attention and enhancing the social experience .   Marriage proposals took place coinciding with the eclipse , and at least one wedding was also planned and took place to coincide with the eclipse . Logistical problems were expected with the influx of visitors , especially for smaller communities . The sale of counterfeit eclipse glasses was also anticipated to be a hazard for eye injuries .   Future total solar eclipses will cross the United States in April 2024 ( 12 states ) and August 2045 ( 10 states ) , and annular solar eclipses -- wherein the Moon appears smaller than the Sun -- will occur in October 2023 ( 9 states ) and June 2048 ( 9 states ) .

The total eclipse had a magnitude of 1.0306 and was visible within a narrow corridor 70 miles ( 110 km ) wide , crossing fourteen of the contiguous United States : Oregon , Idaho , Montana , Wyoming , Nebraska , Kansas , Iowa , Missouri , Illinois , Kentucky , Tennessee , Georgia , North Carolina , and South Carolina . It was first seen from land in the U.S. shortly after 10 : 15 a.m. PDT ( 17 : 15 UTC ) at Oregon 's Pacific coast , and then it progressed eastward through Salem , Oregon ; Idaho Falls , Idaho ; Casper , Wyoming ; Lincoln , Nebraska ; Kansas City , Missouri ; St. Louis , Missouri ; Hopkinsville , Kentucky ; Nashville , Tennessee ; Columbia , South Carolina about 2 : 41 p.m. ; and finally Charleston , South Carolina . A partial eclipse was seen for a greater time period , beginning shortly after 9 : 00 a.m. PDT along the Pacific Coast of Oregon . Weather forecasts predicted clear skies in Western U.S. and some Eastern states , but clouds in the Midwest and East Coast .     Animation of the eclipse shadow .

This was the first total solar eclipse visible from the Southeastern United States since the solar eclipse of March 7 , 1970 . Two NASA WB - 57F flew above the clouds , prolonging the observation time spent in the umbra . A partial solar eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the Moon 's penumbra , including all of North America , particularly areas just south of the totality pass , where the eclipse lasted about 3 -- 5 hours , northern South America , Western Europe , and some of Africa and north - east Asia .   At one location in Wyoming , a small group of astronomers used telescopic lenses to photograph the sun as it was in partial eclipse , while the ISS was also seen to briefly transit the sun .   Other celestial bodies ( edit )     During totality stars and 4 planets were visible , including Regulus close to the Sun . Mars was 8 degrees to the right , and Venus 34 degrees right . Mercury was 10 degrees left , and Jupiter 51 degrees left .   Solar eclipse and star - system Regulus ( upper left ) viewed from Cullowhee , NC .     During the eclipse for a long span of its path of totality , several bright stars and four planets were visible . The star - system Regulus was visible slightly to the west of the Sun . Mars was 8 degrees to the right , and Venus 34 degrees right . Mercury was 10 degrees left , and Jupiter 51 degrees left .   Other eclipses over the United States ( edit )   This was the first total solar eclipse visible from the United States since that of July 11 , 1991 -- which was seen only from part of Hawaii -- and the first visible from the contiguous United States since 1979 . An eclipse of comparable length ( up to 3 minutes , 8 seconds , with the longest eclipse being 6 minutes and 54 seconds ) occurred over the contiguous United States on March 7 , 1970 along the southern portions of the Eastern Seaboard , from Florida to Virginia .   The path of totality of the solar eclipse of February 26 , 1979 crossed only the states of Washington , Oregon , Idaho , Montana , and North Dakota . Many enthusiasts traveled to the Pacific Northwest to view the eclipse , since it would be the last chance to view such an eclipse in the contiguous United States for almost four decades .   Some American scientists and interested amateurs who wanted to experience a total eclipse participated in a four - day Atlantic Ocean cruise to view the solar eclipse of July 10 , 1972 as it passed near Nova Scotia . ( This is referenced in the Carly Simon hit song `` You 're So Vain '' in the lyric , `` Then you flew your Lear Jet up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the Sun . '' ) Organizers of the cruise advertised in astronomical journals and in planetarium announcements , emphasizing the rarity of the event .  The path of totality across the United States  The August 2017 eclipse was the first with a path of totality crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the U.S. since 1918 . Also , its path of totality made landfall exclusively within the United States , making it the first such eclipse since the country 's declaration of independence in 1776 . Prior to this , the path of totality of the eclipse of June 13 , 1257 , was the last to make landfall exclusively on lands currently part of the United States .   The path of the 2017 eclipse crosses with the path of the upcoming total solar eclipse of April 8 , 2024 , with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois in Makanda Township at Cedar Lake , just south of Carbondale . An area of about 9,000 square miles , including the cities of Makanda , Carbondale , Cape Girardeau , Missouri , and Paducah , Kentucky , will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of less than seven years . The cities of Benton , Carbondale , Chester , Harrisburg , Marion , and Metropolis in Illinois ; Cape Girardeau , Farmington , and Perryville in Missouri , as well as Paducah , Kentucky , will also be in the path of the 2024 eclipse , thereby earning the distinction of witnessing two total solar eclipses in seven years .   The solar eclipse of August 12 , 2045 will have a very similar path of totality over the U.S. to the 2017 eclipse : about 400 km ( 250 mi ) to the southwest , also crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the country ; however , totality will be more than twice as long .

Only those in Iceland , Ireland , Northern Ireland , Scotland and the Portuguese Azores archipelago saw the eclipse from beginning to end ; in the rest of the UK , Norway , the Netherlands , Belgium , France , Spain , and Portugal , sunset occurred before the end of the eclipse . In Germany , the beginning of the eclipse was visible just at sunset only in the extreme northwest of the country . In all regions east of the orange line on the map , the eclipse was not visible .   West Africa ( edit )   In some locations in West Africa and western North Africa , a partial eclipse was seen just before and during sunset .   Media and scientific coverage ( edit )  The Moon 's umbra , as seen from the International Space Station  A large number of media outlets broadcast coverage of the eclipse , including television and internet outlets . NASA announced plans to offer streaming coverage through its NASA TV and NASA Edge outlets , using cameras stationed on the ground along the path of totality , along with cameras on high - altitude balloons , jets , and coverage from the International Space Station ; NASA stated that `` never before will a celestial event be viewed by so many and explored from so many vantage points -- from space , from the air , and from the ground . '' ABC , CBS , and NBC announced that they would respectively broadcast live television specials to cover the eclipse with correspondents stationed across the path of totality , along with CNN , Fox News Channel , Science , and The Weather Channel . The PBS series Nova presented streaming coverage on Facebook hosted by Miles O'Brien , and aired a special episode chronicling the event -- `` Eclipse Over America '' -- later in the day ( which marked the fastest production turnaround time in Nova history ) .   Other institutions and services also announced plans to stream their perspectives of the eclipse , including the Exploratorium in San Francisco , the Elephant Sanctuary of Hohenwald , Tennessee , the Slooh robotic telescope app , and The Virtual Telescope Project . The Eclipse Ballooning Project , a consortium of schools and colleges that sent 50 high - altitude balloons into the sky during the eclipse to conduct experiments , provided streams of footage and GPS tracking of its launches . Contact with one balloon with $13,000 of scientific equipment , launched under the aegis of the LGF Museum of Natural History near Vale , Oregon , was lost at 20,000 feet ( 6,100 m ) . Given that the balloon was believed to have burst at 100,000 feet ( 30,000 m ) , it could have parachuted down anywhere from eastern Oregon to Caldwell , Idaho ( most likely ) to Sun Valley , Idaho ; a $1,000 reward is offered for its recovery .   The National Solar Observatory organized Citizen CATE volunteers to man 60 identical telescopes and instrumentation packages along the totality path to study changes in the corona over the duration of the eclipse .   In orbit , the satellites Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , the International Space Station , the Solar Dynamics Observatory , the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer , Solar and Heliospheric Observatory , and Hinode gathered data from the eclipse .   A viewing party was held at the White House , during which President Donald Trump appeared on the Truman Balcony with First Lady Melania Trump . With the sun partially eclipsed , President Trump looked briefly in the general direction of the sun before using solar viewing glasses .   The rapper Joey Badass boasted of watching the solar eclipse without viewing glasses , considering that `` our ancestors ai n't have no fancy eyewear ( and ) they ai n't all go blind '' . Unlike the US president , he did not wear viewing glasses during the entire eclipse . Later , he complained of vision problems and had to cancel his Cleveland , Chicago & Toronto shows on the Everybody Tour , due to `` unforeseen circumstances '' .   The eclipse generated reports of abnormal behavior in animal and plant life . Some farm animals including domestic chickens came out from under their coops and began grooming , usually an evening activity . Horses also displayed increased whinnying , running , and jumping after the event . Cicadas were reported to grow louder before going silent during totality . Various birds were also observed flying in unusually large formations . Flowers such as the Hibiscus closed their petals which typically happens at night , before opening again after the solar event .   NASA reported over 90 million page views of the eclipse on its websites , making it the agency 's biggest online event ever , beating the previous web traffic record about seven times over .   Counterfeit eclipse glasses ( edit )  See also : Solar viewer  In the months leading up to the eclipse , many counterfeit glasses were put up for sale . Effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light , but most UV and infrared light as well . For visible light , the user should only be able to see the Sun , sunglint reflected off shiny metal , halogen bulbs , the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs , and similarly intense sources . Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and infrared light requires the use of spectrophotometer , which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment .   The eye 's retina lacks pain receptors , and thus damage can occur without one 's awareness .   The American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) said products meeting the ISO 12312 - 2 standard avoid risk to one 's eyes , and issued a list of reputable vendors of eclipse glasses . The organization warned against products claiming ISO certification or even citing the same number , but not tested by an accredited laboratory . Another problem was counterfeits of reputable vendors ' products , some even claiming the company 's name such as with American Paper Optics which published information detailing the differences between its glasses and counterfeits .   Andrew Lund , the owner of a company which produces eclipse glasses , noted that not all counterfeit glasses were necessarily unsafe . He stated to Quartz that the counterfeits he tested blocked the majority of harmful light spectrum , concluding that `` the IP is getting ripped off , but the good news is there are no long - term harmful effects . '' As one example , the Springdale Library in metropolitan Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , accidentally passed out dozens of pairs of counterfeit eclipse glasses , but as of August 23 had not received any reports of eye damage .   On July 27 , 2017 , Amazon required all eclipse viewing products sold on its website have a submission of origin and safety information , and proof of an accredited ISO certification . In mid-August 2017 , Amazon recalled and pulled listings for eclipse viewing glasses that `` may not comply with industry standards '' , and gave refunds to customers who had purchased them .   Eye damage ( edit )   Short - term damage includes solar keratitis , which is similar to sunburn of the cornea . Symptoms usually occur within twenty - four hours and include eye pain and light sensitivity .   Long - term or permanent damage includes solar retinopathy , which occurs when the sun burns a hole in the retina , usually at the fovea ( the focus of the retina ) . Symptoms can occur as long as several weeks after the incident , and can include loss of central vision and / or other vision , as well as eye pain and light sensitivity , afterimages , and changes in color vision .   Depending on the severity of damage , vision problems can last for several months or be permanent .   Dr. Avnish Deobhakta , an ophthalmologist in New York , states that , `` `` If you 're looking at the sun you 're actually focusing , intentionally , the light of the sun onto the spot ( fovea ) where you want the most precise vision . ''   Following a total eclipse in the United Kingdom in 1999 , at least 14 cases of permanent damage were confirmed .   One story of solar eclipse danger was illustrated by the case of Mr. Tomososki , who damaged his eyesight when viewing a 1962 eclipse , leaving him with a pea - sized blind spot for the rest of his life . During the 2017 eclipse he warned the country to not make the mistake he did . While some can recover , the danger of an eclipse comes in part because the excitement can override the instinct to not look at the sun .   Planning ( edit )  A message board on U.S. Route 64 in North Carolina alerting drivers of the eclipse  Officials inside and near the path of totality planned -- sometimes for years -- for the sudden influx of people . Smaller towns struggled to arrange viewing sites and logistics for what could have been a tourism boom or a disaster .   In the American West , illegal camping was a major concern , including near cities like Jackson Hole , Wyoming . Idaho 's Office of Emergency Management said Idaho was a prime viewing state , and advised jurisdictions to prepare for service load increases ; nearly every hotel and motel room , campground , and in some cases backyards for nearly 100 miles ( 160 km ) north and south of the path of totality had been reserved several months , if not years , in advance . The state anticipated up to 500,000 visitors to join its 1.6 million residents .   Oregon deployed six National Guard aircraft and 150 soldiers because the influx of visitors coincided with the state 's fire season . Hospital staffing , and supplies of blood and anti -- snake bite antidote , were augmented along the totality line .   In Oregon , there were reports of hoteliers canceling existing reservations made at the regular market rate and increasing their rate , sometimes threefold or more , for guests staying to view the eclipse . The Oregon Department of Justice ( DOJ ) investigated various complaints and reached settlements with affected customers of at least 10 hotels in the state . These settlements included refunds to the customers and fines paid to the DOJ .   Post-eclipse traffic problems ( edit )   Although traffic to areas within the path of totality was somewhat spread out over the days prior to the eclipse , there were widespread traffic problems across the United States after the event ended . Michael Zeiler , an eclipse cartographer , had estimated that between 1.85 million and 7.4 million people would travel to the path of the eclipse .   In Oregon , an estimated one million people were expected to arrive that the Oregon National Guard was called in to help manage traffic in Madras along US 26 and US 97 . Madras Municipal Airport received more than 400 mostly personal planes that queued for hours while waiting to leave after the eclipse .   Officials in Idaho , where the totality path crossed the center of the state , began planning for the eclipse a year in advance . The state Transportation Department suspended construction projects along Interstate 15 , which traverses Eastern Idaho , from August 18 -- 22 in order to have all lanes open ; their counterparts in neighboring Utah , where many were expected to travel the 220 miles ( 350 km ) north via the highway from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area , did the same . On the morning of the eclipse , many drivers left before dawn , creating traffic volume along I - 15 normally not seen until morning rush hour ; northbound traffic on the interstate in Box Elder County north of Salt Lake City slowed to 10 -- 15 miles per hour ( 16 -- 24 km / h ) . The Idaho State Police ( ISP ) stationed a patrol car along I - 15 every 15 miles ( 24 km ) between Shelley and the Utah border .  Traffic backed up on I - 15 / US 26 south of Idaho Falls  After the eclipse , traffic more than doubled along I - 15 southbound , with extensive traffic jams continuing for eight hours as viewers who had traveled north into the totality path from Utah returned there and to points south . The ISP tweeted a picture of bumper - to - bumper traffic stalled on the interstate just south of Idaho Falls . Motorists reported to local news outlets that it was taking them two hours to travel the 47 miles ( 76 km ) from that city to Pocatello to the south , a journey that normally takes 45 minutes . Others reported that it took three hours to travel from Idaho Falls to the closer city of Blackfoot , 30 miles ( 48 km ) farther north of Pocatello .   In the rest of the state the impact was less severe . Traffic nearly doubled on US 93 , and was up 55 percent on US 20 .   For some northbound travelers on I - 15 , the Montana Department of Transportation had failed to make similar plans to those in Idaho , scheduling a road construction project to begin on August 21 that narrowed a section of the highway to a single northbound lane , near the exit to Clark Canyon Dam south of Dillon . Though that stretch of highway generally has a traffic count of less than 1,000 vehicles per day , on the day of the eclipse there were over a thousand vehicles per hour at peak times . As a result , traffic backed up as far as Lima , creating a delay of at least an hour for travelers heading northward . Further , as construction had not yet begun , drivers observed cones set up but no workers present on the road . While the state traditionally halts construction projects during high traffic periods , a state official admitted `` we ... probably made a bad mistake here in this regard . ''  Traffic waiting to get on Interstate 25 at Glendo , Wyoming , after the eclipse  In Wyoming , estimates were that the population of the state , officially 585,000 , may have doubled or even tripled , with traffic counts on August 21 showing 536,000 more cars than the five - year average for the third Monday in August ; a 68 percent increase . One official offered an estimate of `` two people in every car '' to arrive at a one - million - visitor figure , and others noted that one million was a conservative estimate based on a one - day traffic count of limited portions of major highways . There were additional arrivals by aircraft , plus travelers who arrived early or stayed for additional days . Two days before the eclipse , traffic increased 18 percent over a five - year average , with an additional 131,000 vehicles on the road . Sunday saw an additional 217,000 - vehicle increase .   Following the eclipse , more than 500,000 vehicles traveled Wyoming roads , creating large traffic jams , particularly on southbound and eastbound highways . Drivers reported that it took up to 10 hours to travel 160 miles ( 260 km ) into northern Colorado . There was one traffic fatality , and another fatality related to an off - highway ATV accident , but in general there were far fewer incidents and traffic citations than authorities had anticipated .   In Tennessee , the Knoxville News Sentinel described the traffic problems created by the eclipse as the worst ever seen in that part of the state . One backup along Interstate 75 reached 34 miles ( 55 km ) in length , between Niota and the Interstate 40 interchange at Farragut . A spokesman for the state 's Department of Transportation allowed that the traffic jams were the worst he had seen in six and a half years on the job , noting that accidents had aggravated the already heavy traffic flows , attributed the I - 75 congestion to Knoxville - area residents heading for the totality path at Sweetwater and returning during what was the city 's normal afternoon rush hour .   Before the eclipse , state officials had described their traffic expectations as equivalent to that generated by the Bonnaroo Music Festival , the twice - a-season NASCAR Monster Energy Cup races at Bristol or the formerly - held Boomsday fireworks festival . `` Maybe they should have considered a tsunami of traffic combining all three of those heavily attended events '' , the News Sentinel commented . The Tennessee Highway Patrol made sure that `` ( e ) very trooper not on sick leave or military leave or pre-approved leave ( wa ) s working '' the day of the eclipse ; the state DOT made sure its full complement of emergency - aid HELP trucks were available as well . Alert signs on the highways also warned motorists not to pull over onto the shoulders to watch the eclipse as it could increase the risk of dangerous accidents and block the path of emergency vehicles .   In North Carolina , the Department of Transportation added cameras , message boards and safety patrols in the counties where the total eclipse would take place , as well as stopping road work . The department warned that due to `` unprecedented '' traffic ordinary activities requiring driving might prove difficult , and advised people to act as if there were snow .   In Kentucky , particularly around the Hopkinsville area , which was dubbed `` Eclipseville , USA '' , post-eclipse traffic caused extensive delays . The en masse departure of tourists via Interstate 69 as well as the Western Kentucky Parkway resulted in commute times double or even triple of normal . The Hopkinsville - to - Lexington commute under normal circumstances lasts three and a half hours .   Impact on solar power ( edit )   An eclipse causes a reduction of solar power generation where the Moon shadow covers any solar panel , as do clouds .   The North American Electric Reliability Corporation predicted minor impacts , and attempted to measure the impact of the 2017 eclipse . In California , solar power was projected to decrease by 4 -- 6,000 megawatts at 70 MW / minute , and then ramp up by 90 MW / minute as the shadow passes . CAISO 's typical ramp rate is 29 megawatts per minute . Around 4 GW mainly in North Carolina and Georgia were expected to be 90 percent obscured .   After the 2017 eclipse , grid operators in California reported having lost 3,000 -- 3,500 megawatts of utility - scale solar power , which was made up for by hydropower and gas reliably and as expected , mimicking the usual duck curve . Energy demand management was also used to mitigate the solar drop .   NV Energy prepared for the solar eclipse months in advance and collaborated with 17 western states . When the eclipse began covering California with partial darkness , which reduced its usual amount of solar - generated electricity , NV Energy sent power there . Likewise , when Nevada received less sunlight , other west coast states supplied electricity to it . During the solar eclipse , the state of Nevada lost about 450 megawatts of electricity , the amount used by about a quarter million typical residences .   The 2015 eclipse caused manageable solar power decreases in Europe ; in Germany , solar power dropped from 14 GW to 7 GW , of a 38 GW solar power capacity .   Commemorative stamp ( edit )  Main article : 2017 Total Solar Eclipse stamp  On June 20 , 2017 , the United States Postal Service released the first application of thermochromic ink to postage stamps in its Total Eclipse of the Sun Forever stamp to commemorate the solar eclipse of August 21 , 2017 . When pressed with a finger , body heat turns the black circle in the center of the stamp into an image of the full moon . The stamp image is a photo of the solar eclipse of March 29 , 2006 seen in Jalu , Libya . The photo was taken by retired NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak .

Saros series 145 ( edit )   This solar eclipse is a part of Saros cycle 145 , repeating every 18 years , 11 days , 8 hours , containing 77 events . The series started with a partial solar eclipse on January 4 , 1639 , and reached a first annular eclipse on June 6 , 1891 . It was a hybrid event on June 17 , 1909 , and total eclipses from June 29 , 1927 , through September 9 , 2648 . The series ends at member 77 as a partial eclipse on April 17 , 3009 .

It is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai , one of the seven emirates that make up the country . Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country 's Federal Supreme Council . The city of Dubai is located on the emirate 's northern coastline and heads the Dubai - Sharjah - Ajman metropolitan area . Dubai will host World Expo 2020 .   Dubai emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East . It is also a major transport hub for passengers and cargo . By the 1960s , Dubai 's economy was based on revenues from trade and , to a smaller extent , oil exploration concessions , but oil was not discovered until 1966 . Oil revenue first started to flow in 1969 . Dubai 's oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city , but its reserves are limited and production levels are low : today , less than 5 % of the emirate 's revenue comes from oil .   The Emirate 's Western - style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism , aviation , real estate , and financial services . Dubai was recently named the best destination for Muslim travellers by Salam Standard . Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events . The city has become iconic for its skyscrapers and high - rise buildings , in particular the world 's tallest building , the Burj Khalifa . Dubai has been criticised for human rights violations concerning the city 's largely South Asian and Filipino workforce . Dubai 's property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008 -- 09 following the financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 , but the emirate 's economy has made a return to growth , with a projected 2015 budget surplus .   As of 2012 , Dubai was the 22nd most expensive city in the world and the most expensive city in the Middle East . In 2014 , Dubai 's hotel rooms were rated as the second most expensive in the world , after Geneva . In 2013 , U.S. global consulting firm Mercer rated Dubai the best place to live in the Middle East .

One theory suggests the word was used to describe the souq , which was similar to the souq in Ba . An Arabic proverb says `` Daba Dubai '' ( Arabic : دبا دبي \\u200e ) , meaning `` They came with a lot of money . '' According to Fedel Handhal , a scholar on the UAE 's history and culture , the word Dubai may have come from the word daba ( Arabic : دبا \\u200e ) ( a past tense derivative of yadub ( Arabic : يدب \\u200e ) , which means `` to creep '' ) , referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland . The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word , but to its alternative meaning of `` baby locust '' ( Arabic : جراد \\u200e ) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement . An inhabitant or native of the city is a Dubaian .   History ( edit )  Main articles : History of Dubai and Timeline of Dubai Typical scene in old Dubai , Old District of Al Bastakiya  Although stone tools have been found at many archaeological sites , little is known about the UAE 's early inhabitants as only a few settlements have been found . Many ancient towns in the area were trading centres between the Eastern and Western worlds . The remnants of an ancient mangrove swamp , dated at 7000 BC , were discovered during the construction of sewer lines near Dubai Internet City . The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland , becoming part of the city 's present coastline . Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries . Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area , the people in this region worshiped Bajir ( or Bajar ) . After the spread of Islam in the region , the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south - east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians . Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of Al - Jumayra ( Jumeirah ) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period .   The earliest recorded mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian - Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al - Bakri . The Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai ( Dibei ) for its pearling industry .   Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was , by 1822 , a town of some 7 -- 800 members of the Baniyas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnoon of Abu Dhabi .   In 1833 , following tribal feuding , members of the Al Bu Falasa tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai . The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Ubaid bin Saeed and Maktum bin Butti who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836 , leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty .   Dubai signed the first treaty of Perpetual Maritime Truce in 1820 along with other Trucial States , which was followed by a further treaty in 1853 . It also -- like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast -- entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate 's security in 1892 .   Two catastrophes struck the town during the 1800s . First , in 1841 , a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality , forcing residents to relocate east to Deira . Then , in 1894 , fire swept through Deira , burning down most homes . However , the town 's geographical location continued to attract traders and merchants from around the region . The emir of Dubai was keen to attract foreign traders and lowered trade tax brackets , which lured traders away from Sharjah and Bandar Lengeh , the region 's main trade hubs at the time . Persian merchants naturally looked across to the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf finally making their homes in Dubai . They continued to trade with Lingah , however , as do many of the dhows in Dubai Creek today , and they named their district Bastakiya , after the Bastak region in southern Persia .   Pre-oil Dubai ( edit )  Typical Bastakiya street in Deira  Dubai 's geographical proximity to Iran made it an important trade location . The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen , chiefly those from Iran , many of whom eventually settled in the town . By the beginning of the 20th century , it was an important port .   Dubai was known for its pearl exports until the 1930s ; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the Great Depression in the 1930s and the innovation of cultured pearls . With the collapse of the pearling industry , Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents starved or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf .   In the early days since its inception , Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi . In 1947 , a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border escalated into war . Arbitration by the British and the creation of a buffer frontier running south eastwards from the coast at Ras Hasian resulted in a temporary cessation of hostilities .   Despite a lack of oil , Dubai 's ruler from 1958 , Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum , used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure . Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure , including electricity , telephone services and both the ports and airport operators . An airport of sorts ( a runway built on salt flats ) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and , in 1959 , the emirate 's first hotel , the Airlines Hotel , was constructed . This was followed by the Ambassador and Carlton Hotels in 1968 .  The Al Ras district in Deira , Dubai in the 1960s  On 7 April 1961 , the Dubai - based MV Dara , a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between Basra ( Iraq ) , Kuwait and Bombay ( India ) , was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai . Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al - Quwain , an explosion tore out the second class cabins and started fires . The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred . A flotilla of small boats from Dubai , Sharjah , Ajman and Umm al - Quwain picked up survivors but in all 238 lives were lost in the disaster .   In 1962 the British Political Agent noted that `` Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built ... the Ruler is determined , against advice ( from the British ) to press on with the construction of a jet airport ... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright . ''   In 1962 , with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent , Sheikh Rashid approached his brother in law , the Ruler of Qatar , for a loan to build the first bridge crossing Dubai 's creek . This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the Deira side .   BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai , fearing a lack of demand for seats . However , by the time the asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965 , opening Dubai to both regional and long haul traffic , a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights . In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai 's first duty - free shops .   Oil era ( edit )  View of Downtown Dubai from Burj Khalifa  After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi , oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966 , albeit in far smaller quantities . The first field was named ' Fateh ' or ' good fortune ' . This led the emirate to grant concessions to international oil companies , thus leading to a massive influx of foreign workers , mainly Asians and Middle easterners . Between 1968 and 1975 the city 's population grew by over 300 % .   As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field , located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai , a number of 50,000 gallon storage tanks were built , known locally as ' Kazzans ' , by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field . These were constructed by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company , which gave the beach its local name ( Chicago Beach ) until the Chicago Beach Hotel was demolished and replaced by the Jumeirah Beach Hotel in the late 1990s .   Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion . Oil revenue , flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate 's limited reserves were depleted . Oil accounted for 24 % of GDP in 1990 , but had reduced to 7 % of GDP by 2004 .   Critically , one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of Port Rashid , a deep water free port constructed by British company Halcrow . Originally intended to be a four - berth port , it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing . The project was an outstanding success , with shipping queuing to access the new facilities . The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972 , although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built . Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed .   Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure , including roads , bridges , schools and hospitals .   Reaching the UAE 's Act of union ( edit )  Adi Bitar in a meeting with Sheiks Rashid Al Maktoum , Mohammad Al Maktoum , and Maktoum Al Maktoum in Dubai , 1968  Dubai and the other ' trucial states ' had long been a British protectorate where the British took care of foreign policy and defence , as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf . This was to change with PM Harold Wilson 's announcement , on 16 January 1968 , that all British troops were to be withdrawn from ' East of Aden ' . The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates , together with Qatar and Bahrain , into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind .   The principle of union was first agreed between the ruler of Abu Dhabi , Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan , and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah , near Al Semeih , a desert stop between the two emirates . The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates , including Qatar and Bahrain , into the union . Over the next two years , negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed - often stormy - as a form of union was thrashed out . The nine - state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where heavy - handed British intervention resulted in a walk - out by Qatar and Ras Al Khaimah . Bahrain and Qatar were to drop out of talks , leaving six emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971 .   On 2 December 1971 , Dubai , together with Abu Dhabi , Sharjah , Ajman , Umm al - Quwain and Fujairah joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates . The seventh emirate , Ras Al Khaimah , joined the UAE on 10 February 1972 , following Iran 's annexation of the RAK - claimed Tunbs islands .   In 1973 , Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency : the UAE dirham . In that same year , the prior monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates .   Modern Dubai ( edit )  Dubai Palm Jumeirah and Marina in 2011  During the 1970s , Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade , even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war . Border disputes between the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE ; it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached that ended disagreements . The Jebel Ali port was established in 1979 . JAFZA ( Jebel Ali Free Zone ) was built around the port in 1985 to provide foreign companies unrestricted import of labour and export capital . Dubai airport and the aviation industry also continued to grow .   The Gulf War of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city , as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade , but subsequently , the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived . Later in the 1990s , many foreign trading communities -- first from Kuwait , during the Gulf War , and later from Bahrain , during the Shia unrest -- moved their businesses to Dubai . Dubai provided refuelling bases to allied forces at the Jebel Ali Free Zone during the Gulf War , and again during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq . Large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism .

In the false - color satellite images making up the video , bare desert is tan , plant - covered land is red , water is black and urban areas are silver . Sand dunes on the city outskirts Abras across the Dubai Creek  Dubai is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level ( 16 m or 52 ft above ) . The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south , Sharjah in the northeast , and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast . Hatta , a minor exclave of the emirate , is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman ( in the west ) and Ras Al Khaimah ( in the north ) . The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate . Dubai is positioned at 25 ° 16 ′ 11 '' N 55 ° 18 ′ 34 '' E \\ufeff / \\ufeff 25.2697 ° N 55.3095 ° E \\ufeff / 25.2697 ; 55.3095 and covers an area of 1,588 sq mi ( 4,110 km ) , which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial 1,500 sq mi ( 3,900 km ) designation due to land reclamation from the sea .   Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert . However , the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai 's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns , while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country . The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine , clean and white . East of the city , the salt - crusted coastal plains , known as sabkha , give way to a north - south running line of dunes . Farther east , the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide .   The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains , which run alongside Dubai 's border with Oman at Hatta . The Western Hajar chain has an arid , jagged and shattered landscape , whose mountains rise to about 1,300 metres ( 4,265 feet ) in some places . Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases ; however , Dubai does have a natural inlet , Dubai Creek , which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through . Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes , which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains . A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter . Seismically , Dubai is in a very stable zone -- the nearest seismic fault line , the Zagros Fault , is 200 kilometres ( 124 miles ) from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai . Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami .   The sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms . Desert hyacinths grow in the sabkha plains east of the city , while acacia and ghaf trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains . Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and neem as well as imported trees such as the eucalypts grow in Dubai 's natural parks . The houbara bustard , striped hyena , caracal , desert fox , falcon and Arabian oryx are common in Dubai 's desert . Dubai is on the migration path between Europe , Asia and Africa , and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn . The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish , including the hammour . The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish , jellyfish , coral , dugong , dolphins , whales and sharks . Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the hawksbill turtle and green turtle , which are listed as endangered species .   Dubai Creek runs northeast - southwest through the city . The eastern section of the city forms the locality of Deira and is flanked by the emirate of Sharjah in the east and the town of Al Aweer in the south . The Dubai International Airport is located south of Deira , while the Palm Deira is located north of Deira in the Persian Gulf . Much of Dubai 's real - estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek , on the Jumeirah coastal belt . Port Rashid , Jebel Ali , Burj Al Arab , the Palm Jumeirah and theme - based free - zone clusters such as Business Bay are all located in this section . Dubai is notable for sculpted artificial island complexes including the Palm Islands and The World archipelago .   Climate ( edit )  Main article : Climate of Dubai  Dubai has a hot desert climate . Summers in Dubai are extremely hot , windy , and humid , with an average high around 41 ° C ( 106 ° F ) and overnight lows around 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) in the hottest month , August . Most days are sunny throughout the year . Winters are warm with an average high of 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) and overnight lows of 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) in January , the coldest month . Precipitation , however , has been increasing in the last few decades , with accumulated rain reaching 94.3 mm ( 3.71 in ) per year . Dubai summers are also known for the very high humidity level , which can make it very uncomfortable for many with exceptionally high dewpoints in summer . The highest recorded temperature in the UAE is 52.1 ° C ( 126 ° F ) , reached in July 2002 .

The ruler , His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , is also the Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and member of the Supreme Council of the Union ( SCU ) . Dubai appoints 8 members in two - term periods to the Federal National Council ( FNC ) of the UAE , the supreme federal legislative body .   The Dubai Municipality ( DM ) was established by the then - ruler of Dubai , Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum , in 1954 for purposes of city planning , citizen services and upkeep of local facilities . DM is chaired by Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum , deputy ruler of Dubai , and comprises several departments such as the Roads Department , Planning and Survey Department , Environment and Public Health Department and Financial Affairs Department . In 2001 , Dubai Municipality embarked on an e-Government project with the intention of providing 40 of its city services through its web portal , ( dubai.ae ) . Thirteen such services were launched by October 2001 , while several other services were expected to be operational in the future . Dubai Municipality is also in charge of the city 's sanitation and sewage infrastructure .   The UAE has a Minister of Happiness , appointed by Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum . The UAE has also appointed a Minister of Tolerance to promote tolerance as a fundamental value of the UAE , a country filled with a diverse range of faiths and ethnicities , and also a Minister for Youth Affairs .   Law enforcement ( edit )   The Dubai Police Force , founded in 1956 in the locality of Naif , has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate . The force is under direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum .  Dubai Police operates a fleet of exotic cars .  Dubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only emirates that do not conform to the federal judicial system of the United Arab Emirates . The emirate 's judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance , the Court of Appeal , and the Court of Cassation . The Court of First Instance consists of the Civil Court , which hears all civil claims ; the Criminal Court , which hears claims originating from police complaints ; and Sharia Court , which is responsible for matters between Muslims . Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court . The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only .   Sharia laws ( edit )   Kissing in certain places is illegal and can result in deportation . Sometimes , certain narrow exemptions to Islamic law are made for adult non-Muslims . Adult non-Muslims are allowed to consume alcohol in licensed venues , typically within hotels , or at home with the possession of an alcohol license . Restaurants outside hotels in Dubai are typically not permitted to sell alcohol . Like other parts of the world , drinking and driving is illegal .   Human rights ( edit )  Main article : Human rights in Dubai  Human rights organisations have heavily criticised violations of human rights in Dubai . In a notorious case , a Norwegian businesswoman who claimed to have been raped was arrested and sentenced to sixteen months in prison for having extra-marital sex .   Some of the 250,000 foreign labourers in the city have been alleged to live in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as `` less than humane '' . The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the difficult - to - make documentary , Slaves in Dubai ( 2009 ) . The Dubai government has denied labour injustices and stated that the watchdog 's ( Human Rights Watch ) accusations were ' misguided ' . The filmmaker explained in interviews how it was necessary to go undercover to avoid discovery by the authorities , who impose high fines on reporters attempting to document human rights abuses , including the conditions of construction workers . Towards the end of March 2006 , the government had announced steps to allow construction unions . UAE labour minister Ali al - Kaabi said : `` Labourers will be allowed to form unions .

As of June 2017 , the population is 2,789,000 . The region covers 1,287.5 square kilometres ( 497.1 sq mi ) . The population density is 408.18 / km -- more than eight times that of the entire country . Dubai is the second most expensive city in the region and 20th most expensive city in the world .   As of 2013 , only about 15 % of the population of the emirate was made up of UAE nationals , with the rest comprising expatriates , many of whom either have been in the country for generations or were born in the UAE . Approximately 85 % of the expatriate population ( and 71 % of the emirate 's total population ) was Asian , chiefly Indian ( 51 % ) and Pakistani ( 16 % ) ; other significant Asian groups include Bangladeshis ( 9 % ) and Filipinos ( 3 % ) . There is a sizable community of Somalis numbering around 30,000 , as well as other communities of various nationalities . A quarter of the population ( local and foreign ) reportedly traces their origins to Iran . In addition , 16 % of the population ( or 288,000 persons ) living in collective labour accommodation were not identified by ethnicity or nationality , but were thought to be primarily Asian . There are over 100,000 British expatriates in Dubai , by far the largest group of Western expatriates in the city . The median age in the emirate was about 27 years . In 2014 , there were estimated to be 15.54 births and 1.99 deaths per 1,000 people . There are other Arab nationals , including GCC nationals .   Arabic is the national and official language of the United Arab Emirates . The Gulf dialect of Arabic is spoken natively by the Emirati people . English is used as a second language . Other major languages spoken in Dubai due to immigration are Malayalam , Hindi - Urdu ( or Hindustani ) , Gujarati , Persian , Sindhi , Tamil , Punjabi , Pashto , Bengali , Balochi , Tulu , Kannada , Sinhala , Marathi , Telugu , Tagalog and Chinese , in addition to many other languages .   Religion ( edit )  See also : Islam in the United Arab Emirates and Religion in the United Arab Emirates Jumeirah Mosque  Article 7 of the UAE 's Provisional Constitution declares Islam the official state religion of the UAE . The government subsidises almost 95 % of mosques and employs all Imams ; approximately 5 % of mosques are entirely private , and several large mosques have large private endowments . All mosques in Dubai are managed by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department also known as `` Awqaf '' under the Government of Dubai and all Imams are appointed by the Government . Any person held preaching racism , religious hatred or promoting religious extremism is usually jailed and deported .  Minorities ( edit ) Evangelical church in Dubai  Dubai also has large Christian , Hindu , Sikh , Bahá'í , Buddhist and other religious communities residing in the city .   Non-Muslim groups can own their own houses of worship , where they can practice their religion freely , by requesting a land grant and permission to build a compound . Groups that do not have their own buildings must use the facilities of other religious organisations or worship in private homes . Non-Muslim religious groups are permitted to advertise group functions openly and distribute various religious literature . However , outright proselytising is strictly prohibited under penalty of criminal prosecution , imprisonment and deportation for engaging in behaviour offensive to Islam . Catholics are served pastorally by the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia . British preacher Reverend Andrew Thompson claimed that the United Arab Emirates is one of the most tolerant places in the world towards Christians , and that it is easier to be a Christian in the UAE , than in the UK .   Economy ( edit )  Main article : Economy of Dubai Jebel Ali Port  One of the world 's fastest growing economies , Dubai 's gross domestic product is projected at US $107.1 billion , with a growth rate of 6.1 % in 2014 . Although a number of core elements of Dubai 's trading infrastructure were built on the back of the oil industry , revenues from oil and natural gas account for less than 5 % of the emirate 's revenues . It is estimated that Dubai produces 50,000 to 70,000 barrels ( 7,900 to 11,100 m ) of oil a day and substantial quantities of gas from offshore fields . The emirate 's share in the UAE 's total gas revenues is about 2 % . Dubai 's oil reserves have diminished significantly and are expected to be exhausted in 20 years . Real estate and construction ( 22.6 % ) , trade ( 16 % ) , entrepôt ( 15 % ) and financial services ( 11 % ) are the largest contributors to Dubai 's economy .   Dubai 's non-oil foreign trade stood at $362 billion in 2014 . Of the overall trade volumes , imports had the biggest share with a value of $230 billion while exports and re-exports to the emirate stood at $31 billion and $101 billion respectively .   By 2014 , China had emerged as Dubai 's largest international trading partner , with a total of $47.7 billion in trade flows , up 29 % from 2013 . India was second among Dubai 's key trading partners with a trade of $29.7 billion , followed by the United States at $22.62 billion . The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was Dubai 's fourth trading partner globally and first in the GCC and Arab world with a total trade value of $14.2 billion . Trade with Germany in 2014 totalled $12.3 , Switzerland and Japan both at $11.72 billion and UK trade totalled $10.9 billion .  Dubai Creek , which separates Deira from Bur Dubai , played a vital role in the economic development of the city  Historically , Dubai and its twin across Dubai Creek , Deira ( independent of Dubai City at that time ) , were important ports of call for Western manufacturers . Most of the new city 's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area . Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s . Dubai has a free trade in gold and , until the 1990s , was the hub of a `` brisk smuggling trade '' of gold ingots to India , where gold import was restricted . Dubai 's Jebel Ali port , constructed in the 1970s , has the largest man - made harbour in the world and was ranked seventh globally for the volume of container traffic it supports . Dubai is also a hub for service industries such as information technology and finance , with industry - specific free zones throughout the city . Dubai Internet City , combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM ( Dubai Technology , Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority ) , is one such enclave , whose members include IT firms such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise , HP Inc. , Google , EMC Corporation , Oracle Corporation , Microsoft , Dell and IBM , and media organisations such as MBC , CNN , BBC , Reuters , Sky News and AP .   The government 's decision to diversify from a trade - based , oil - reliant economy to one that is service - and tourism - oriented made property more valuable , resulting in the property appreciation from 2004 to 2006 . A longer - term assessment of Dubai 's property market , however , showed depreciation ; some properties lost as much as 64 % of their value from 2001 to November 2008 . The large - scale real estate development projects have led to the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest projects in the world such as the Emirates Towers , the Burj Khalifa , the Palm Islands and the most expensive hotel , the Burj Al Arab . Dubai 's property market experienced a major downturn in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the slowing economic climate . By early 2009 , the situation had worsened with the Great Recession taking a heavy toll on property values , construction and employment . This has had a major impact on property investors in the region , some of whom were unable to release funds from investments made in property developments . As of February 2009 , Dubai 's foreign debt was estimated at approximately $80 billion , although this is a tiny fraction of the sovereign debt worldwide . Dubai real estate and UAE property experts believe that by avoiding the mistakes of the past , Dubai 's realty market can achieve stability in the future .  Downtown Dubai  The Dubai Financial Market ( DFM ) was established in March 2000 as a secondary market for trading securities and bonds , both local and foreign . As of fourth quarter 2006 , its trading volume stood at about 400 billion shares , worth $95 billion in total . The DFM had a market capitalisation of about $87 billion . The other Dubai - based stock exchange is NASDAQ Dubai , which is the international stock exchange in the Middle East . It enables a range of companies , including UAE and regional small and medium - sized enterprises , to trade on an exchange with an international brand name , with access by both regional and international investors .   DMCC ( Dubai Multi Commodities Centre ) was established in 2002 . It 's world 's fastest growing free zone and been nominated as `` Global Free Zone of the Year 2016 '' by The Financial Times fDi Magazine .   Dubai is also known as the City of Gold , because a major part of the economy is based on gold trades , with Dubai 's total gold trading volumes in H1 2011 reaching 580 tonnes , with an average price of US $1,455 per troy ounce .

( September 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     `` All That is Gold Does Not Glitter '' ( alternatively known as `` The Riddle of Strider '' or `` Song of Aragorn '' ) is a poem written by J.R.R. Tolkien for his fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings . It alludes to an integral part of the plot , and describes Aragorn , son of Arathorn .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Poem   2 Overview   3 Older version   4 References      Poem ( edit )    All that is gold does not glitter ,   Not all those who wander are lost ;   The old that is strong does not wither ,   Deep roots are not reached by the frost .     From the ashes , a fire shall be woken ,   A light from the shadows shall spring ;   Renewed shall be blade that was broken ,   The crownless again shall be king .    Overview ( edit )   The poem appears twice in The Fellowship of the Ring , the first volume of The Lord of the Rings . It appears first in Chapter Ten , `` Strider '' , in Gandalf 's letter to Frodo Baggins in Bree , although when Frodo reads it he does not realize that Strider ( Aragorn ) is the subject of the verse .   The verse is repeated by Bilbo at the Council of Elrond . He whispers to Frodo that he wrote it many years before , when Aragorn first revealed who he was .   In Peter Jackson 's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings for film , the poem appears in The Return of the King , when Arwen recites the last four lines of the poem as her father Elrond prepares to reforge the shards of Narsil for Aragorn . In the 1981 BBC radio dramatisation , the entire poem is heard in its original context , the letter left at Bree by Gandalf .   The way appearance displays reality in our world is largely inverted in Middle - earth with respect to the subject matter of the poem . The first line is a variant and rearrangement of the proverb `` All that glitters is not gold '' , known primarily from Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice , resulting in a proposition bearing a completely different meaning : Aragorn is vastly more important than he looks . The second line emphasizes the importance of the Rangers , suspiciously viewed as wanderers or vagabonds by those the Rangers actually protect from evil . Lines three and four emphasize the endurance of Aragorn 's royal lineage , while five and six emphasizes its renewal . They can also be seen to represent a spark of hope during a time of despair and danger . Line seven refers to the sword Narsil . Line eight foreshadows the crownless Aragorn 's accession to the throne of both the kingless Gondor and the vanished Arnor .   Older editions of The Lord of the Rings indexed the poem as `` The Riddle of Strider '' . From the 50th anniversary edition of 2005 on , the new , enlarged index by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull list it as `` All that is gold does not glitter '' .   Older version ( edit )   The early versions of the poem are recorded in The Treason of Isengard , part of The History of Middle - earth book series by Christopher Tolkien . The first draft of the poem , which at that stage of composition was the only content of Gandalf 's letter , reads :    All that is gold does not glitter ;   all that is long does not last ;   All that is old does not wither ;   not all that is over is past .    The second quatrain was added during the following revision :    Not all that have fallen are vanquished ;   a king may yet be without crown ,   A blade that was broken be brandished ;   and towers that were strong may fall down .    The lines were changed in stages , with many experimental forms rejected . Christopher Tolkien also suggested that `` the Sword that was Broken ( Narsil ) actually emerged from the verse ' All that is gold does not glitter ' : on this view , in ( the last version cited above ) the words a king may yet be without crown , A blade that was broken be brandished were no more than a further exemplification of the general moral .

Production ( edit )   Development ( edit )   Executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis announced that they were ending the half - season arc structure that was seen in seasons three through five , with Horowitz saying , `` We 're also planning a 22 - episode story as opposed to breaking it up into two halves this year . It has been really exciting and fun . '' Kitsis added : `` We are changing around what we 're doing this year and going back to that season 1 mentality of small town stories and smaller arcs . '' This season will focus on Storybrooke as the main setting , but will also show new realms and there will be the exploration of the Savior 's mythology . Kitsis and Horowitz hired two directors from their Freeform series Dead of Summer , Norman Buckley , Mairzee Almas , and Michael Schultz helm episodes of the season . Jennifer Lynch directed the eighth episode of the season , `` I 'll Be Your Mirror '' .   In January 2017 , ABC president Channing Dungey had been the first to suggest that the current narrative of the show would end with season six , regardless of whether or not there is a season seven . Shortly after this news , Jennifer Morrison revealed that the contracts for the original main cast members were expiring in April , expressing uncertainty about the future of the show and her participation in it beyond the current season . Robert Carlyle also expressed that he 'd have to make a decision about his future on the show by the end of that month . In March 2017 , several sources had reported that four of the current main cast members in particular - Morrison , Carlyle , Lana Parrilla , and Colin O'Donoghue - were in negotiations to renew their contracts for a potential seventh season . In April 2017 , Horowitz and Kitsis confirmed that a group of characters will indeed have their stories wrapped up by the end of the season in acknowledging the potential cast changes , saying : `` We planned this finale from the beginning of the year , so whoever stays and whoever goes ... all those questions have already been dealt with . The audience does not have to fear ( anything feeling ) incomplete . '' On May 8 , Morrison confirmed that she had declined an offer to remain on the show and that the sixth season would be her last , signaling the end of Emma 's time on the show as the main protagonist . On May 11 , Rebecca Mader announced that she would also be leaving the show at the end of the season , citing creative decisions beyond her control . On May 12 , season six was announced to be the last for four additional main actors : Ginnifer Goodwin , Josh Dallas , Jared Gilmore , and Emilie de Ravin . Thus , characters seeing their storylines wrapped up in the season six finale include Emma Swan , Snow White , Prince Charming , Belle , and Zelena . The season finale revealed that Henry Mills will remain a series protagonist , with the setting shifting to a later time period in which he is portrayed as an adult by Andrew J. West .  Musical episode ( edit ) Main article : The Song in Your Heart  In January 2017 , TV Line reported that the series would feature a musical episode later in the season . Creators Kitsis and Horowitz had spoken about the desire to do a musical installment previously , but did n't `` even know where to begin . '' Kitsis and Horowitz confirmed the report in February . They have also since confirmed that the episode will feature 7 original songs , including solos by Jennifer Morrison and Rebecca Mader , as well as a `` sing - off '' musical number featuring the Evil Queen and the Charmings . Composers Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner will be writing the original numbers featured , with arrangements provided by the show 's long - time composer Mark Isham . Kitsis and Hororwitz spoke about the nature of the episode saying , `` It actually is a huge part of the mythology of the show and there are some big things that happen in the episode , frankly , it 's been one of the challenges of doing the musical because we never wanted to do something where it was just like a to - the - side , one - off thing , and then get back to the main story . We want to see it part of the main story , which meant we had to really plan out this season with some great detail . ''   Casting ( edit )  Horowitz : There certainly are nods to the film that we all love so much , that we 're peppering in throughout . We 're , right now , focusing on ( Aladdin , Jasmine , and Jafar ) . Kitsis : Obviously , I do n't think we would touch the genie . I would like to see a monkey but I ca n't promise anything . I think , whereas some stories , like Frozen , we were very faithful to Frozen , I think you will see Aladdin will have its own Once twist .  -- Executive producers Kitsis and Horowitz on Once 's interpretation of Aladdin .

       "  'document_text_clean': \"Gun laws in Georgia - wikipedia  Gun laws in Georgia  Jump to : navigation , search  Gun laws in the state of Georgia regulate the sale , possession , and use of firearms and ammunition in the state of Georgia in the United States . It does not however affect the laws of other states . The Georgia Constitution , like many other state constitutions , guarantees to its citizen the right to keep and bear arms . Article one , section one , paragraph VII of the Georgia Constitution states : `` The right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed , but the General Assembly shall have the power to prescribe the manner in which arms may be borne . ''  Location of Georgia in the United States    Contents  ( hide )   1 Overview   2 Summary table   3 See also   4 References      Overview ( edit )   On June 8 , 2010 , Senate Bill 308 was signed by Governor Sonny Perdue reforming and clarifying many of Georgia 's Gun Laws , while leaving certain restrictions in place .   Georgia is a `` shall issue '' state , with the Georgia Weapons Carry License application to be submitted through the probate court of the county of residence .   Georgia reciprocates in recognizing firearms licenses with the following states : Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , Colorado , Florida , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maine , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , New Hampshire , North Carolina , North Dakota , Ohio , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Utah , Virginia , West Virginia , Wisconsin , and Wyoming .   South Carolina H3799 was signed by Gov Haley on June 3 , 2016 , allowing reciprocity with Georgia CCW permits .   There are a number of ways a firearm can be carried without a permit . No permit is needed :    To carry a firearm in a person 's home , place of business , or vehicle   To carry a long gun in a fully open and exposed manner   To carry an unloaded firearm in a case   To carry a firearm in someone else 's vehicle , provided you would qualify for a permit   To carry a firearm while fishing or hunting , if you have a valid fishing or hunting license    State preemption laws prohibit localities from regulating the ownership , transportation , and possession of firearms . Georgia also has a law preventing localities from enacting ordinances or lawsuits to classify gun ranges as nuisances . This means that local parks , offices , etc. of non-Federal government agencies may not prohibit those with a valid Georgia Weapons License from carrying . Federal regulations continue to prohibit carrying weapons on Corps of Engineers and US Postal Service property .  Beyond a few exceptions , a person may not carry a handgun openly in Georgia without having a valid GWCL  Firearm regulations are uniform throughout the state , and a firearms permit is valid throughout the state , in all areas other than in a few specially - defined areas . These specially - defined prohibited areas include :    In a government building , where ingress into such building is restricted or screened by security personnel and overseen by a POST certified swore peace officer   In a courthouse   In a jail or prison   In a place of worship , unless the governing body or authority of the place of worship permits the carrying of weapons or long guns by license holders   In a state mental health facility   On the premises of a nuclear power facility   Within 150 feet ( 46 m ) of any polling place , only during an election .   On school grounds ( incl . building and grounds ) , unless carrying or picking up a student , or permitted in writing by an official of the school , however weapons may be securely stored in vehicles parked on school grounds .    As exceptions to the above list , a person may keep their firearm in a locked compartment of their vehicle at any of the above places except nuclear power facilities . Also , a person may approach security or management of any of the above places ( except schools and nuclear power facilities ) and ask them for directions on removing , securing , storing , or temporarily surrendering the weapon .   As of July 1 , 2006 , Georgia became a `` Stand Your Ground '' state , and requires no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self - defense , or defense of others .   Georgia law allows private firearm sales between residents without requiring any processing through an FFL .   A Kennesaw , GA city ordinance requires that all homeowners own a firearm and ammunition ( Sec 34 - 1a ) . No one has ever been charged with violating this ordinance . An amendment exempts those who conscientiously object to owning a firearm , convicted felons , those who can not afford a firearm , and those with a mental or physical disability that would prevent them from owning a firearm .   As of the 23rd of April , 2014 , Georgia 's gun laws were drastically revised when Governor Nathan Deal signed House Bill 60 , or the Safe Carry Protection Act , into action . The Safe Carry Protection Act changed many of the currently enacted gun laws in place beforehand .   In 2017 , the Georgia legislature passed HB 280 , which allows for concealed carry permit holders to carry concealed handguns on public college campuses . Governor Nathan Deal signed it into law on May 4 , 2017 . The law took effect July 1 , 2017 on all University System of Georgia Campuses , including universities , colleges , and trade schools under the University System . Under HB280 any Georgia Weapons Licensee may carry on University System of Georgia property if they are carrying concealed . They may not carry in any dormitory or Greek house owned by the University System , in any athletic venue used for intercollegiate sports , in any daycare facility on campus with limited entry ( gated ) , in any classroom with a currently enrolled high school student , in any private office space , or in any room currently in use for disciplinary proceedings . HB280 does not remove the prohibition against carry on private university and college property under Georgia Law .

( March 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )    ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Broadcasting syndication is the license to broadcast television programs and radio programs by multiple television stations and radio stations , without going through a broadcast network . It is common in the United States where broadcast programming is scheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates . Syndication is less of a practice in the rest of the world , as most countries have centralized networks or television stations without local affiliates ; although less common , shows can be syndicated internationally . The three main types of syndication are `` first - run syndication '' , which is programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show and is made specifically to sell directly into syndication ; `` off - network syndication '' , which is the licensing of a program that was originally run on network TV or , in some cases , first - run syndication ( colloquially called a `` rerun '' ) ; and `` public broadcasting syndication '' .

Reruns are usually found on stations affiliated with smaller networks like Fox or The CW , especially since these networks broadcast one less hour of prime time network programming than the Big Three television networks and far less network - provided daytime television ( only one hour for The CW , none at all for Fox ) . A show usually enters off - network syndication when it has built up about four seasons ' worth or between 80 and 100 episodes , though for some genres the number could be as low as 65 . Successful shows in syndication can cover production costs and make a profit , even if the first run of the show was not profitable .   Public broadcasting syndication   This type of syndication has arisen in the U.S. as a parallel service to member stations of the Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) and the handful of independent public broadcasting stations . This form of syndication more closely resembles the news agency model , where nominally competing networks share resources and rebroadcast each other 's programs . For example , National Public Radio ( NPR ) stations commonly air the Public Radio Exchange 's This American Life , which may contain stories produced by NPR journalists .    When syndicating a show , the production company , or a distribution company called a syndicator , attempts to license the show to one station in each media market or area , or to a commonly owned station group , within the country and internationally . If successful , this can be lucrative , but the syndicator may only be able to license the show in a small percentage of the markets . Syndication differs from licensing the show to a television network . Once a network picks up a show , it is usually guaranteed to run on most or all the network 's affiliates on the same day of the week and at the same time ( in a given time zone , in countries where this is a concern ) . Some production companies create their shows and license them to networks at a loss , at least at first , hoping that the series will succeed and that eventual off - network syndication will turn a profit for the show . A syndicated program is licensed to stations for `` cash '' ( the stations purchase the rights to insert some or all of the advertisements at their level ) ; given to stations for access to airtime ( wherein the syndicators get the advertising revenue ) ; or the combination of both . The trade of program for airtime is called `` barter . ''   In the United States ( as a result of continued relaxation of station ownership regulations since the 1970s ) , syndicated programs are usually licensed to stations on a group level , with multiple stations owned and / or operated by the same broadcasting group carrying the program in different markets ( except in areas where another station holds the market rights to the program ) -- making it increasingly more efficient for syndicators to gain widespread national clearances for their programs . Many syndicated programs are traditionally sold first to one of five `` key '' station groups ( ABC Owned Television Stations , NBC Owned Television Stations , CBS Television Stations , Fox Television Stations and Tribune Broadcasting ) , allowing their programs to gain clearances in the largest U.S. TV markets ( such as New York City , Los Angeles , Chicago and Philadelphia , where all five aforementioned groups each own stations ) , before striking deals with other major and smaller station owners . Shows airing in first - run syndication that are carried primarily by an owned - and - operated station of a network may sometimes be incorrectly referenced as a network program , regardless to its distribution to stations of varying network affiliations and despite the fact it is not part of an individual network 's base schedule .   Since the early 2000s , some programs being proposed for national distribution in first - run syndication have been test marketed on a selected number of or all stations owned by certain major station group , allowing the distributor to determine whether a national roll - out is feasible based on the ratings accrued in the selected markets where the program is being aired .   While market penetration can vary widely and revenues can be unreliable , the producers often enjoy more content freedom in the absence of network 's standards and practices departments ; frequently , some innovative ideas are explored by first - run syndicated programming which the networks are leery of giving airtime to . Meanwhile , top - rated syndicated shows in the United States usually have a domestic market reach as high as 98 % . Very often , series ' that are aired in syndication have reduced running times . For example , a standard American sitcom runs 22 minutes , but in syndication it may be reduced to 20 minutes to make room for more commercials .   Syndication can take the form of either weekly or daily syndication . Game shows , some `` tabloid '' and entertainment news shows , and talk shows are broadcast daily on weekdays , while most other first - run syndicated shows are broadcast on a weekly basis and are usually aired on weekends only . Big discussion occurred in the 1990s and 2000s about whether previously aired episodes of a show could become syndicated while new episodes of it continued to air on its original network . There had been much opposition to this idea and it was generally viewed to lead to the death of the show . However , licensing a program for syndication actually resulted in the increased popularity for shows that remained in production . A prime example is Law & Order .   First - run syndication in the U.S. ( edit )   As with radio in the U.S. , television networks , particularly in their early years , did not offer a full day 's worth of programming for their affiliates , even in the evening or `` prime time '' hours . In the early days of television , this was less of an issue , as there were in most markets fewer TV stations than there were networks ( at the time four ) , which meant that the stations that did exist affiliated with multiple networks and , when not airing network or local programs , typically signed off . The loosening of licensing restrictions , and the subsequent passage of the All - Channel Receiver Act , meant that by the early 1960s , the situation had reversed . There were now more stations than the networks , now down to three after the failure of the DuMont Television Network , could serve . Some stations were not affiliated with any network , operating as independent stations . Both groups sought to supplement their locally produced programming with content that could be flexibly scheduled . The development of videotape and , much later , enhanced satellite downlink access furthered these options . While most past first - run syndicated shows were shown only in syndication , some canceled network shows continued to be produced for first - run syndication or were revived for syndication several years after their original cancellation . Until about 1980 , most syndicated series were distributed to stations either on 16mm film prints ( off - network reruns , feature films , and cartoons ) or videotape ( topical series such as the talk shows of Mike Douglas and Merv Griffin , and variety and quiz shows . )   Ziv Television Programs , Inc. , after establishing itself as a major radio syndicator , was the first major first - run television syndicator , creating several long - lived series in the 1950s and selling them directly to regional sponsors , who in turn sold the shows to local stations . Ziv 's first major TV hit was The Cisco Kid . Ziv had the foresight to film the Cisco Kid series in color , even though color TV was still in its infancy and most stations did not yet support the technology . Among the most widely seen Ziv offerings were Sea Hunt , I Led Three Lives , Highway Patrol and Ripcord . Some first - run syndicated series were picked up by networks in the 1950s and early 1960s , such as the Adventures of Superman and Mr. Ed . The networks began syndicating their reruns in the late 1950s , and first - run syndication shrank sharply , for a decade . Some stalwart series continued , including Death Valley Days ; other ambitious projects were also to flourish , however briefly , such as The Play of the Week ( 1959 -- 1961 ) , produced by David Susskind ( of the syndicated talk show Open End and also producer of such network fare as NYPD ) .   Among other syndicated series of the 1950s were MCA 's The Abbott and Costello Show ( vaudeville - style comedy ) and Guild Films ' Liberace ( musical variety ) and Life With Elizabeth , a domestic situation comedy that introduced Betty White to a national audience . In addition to the Adventures of Superman , many other series were based on comic strips and aimed at the juvenile audience , including Flash Gordon , Dick Tracy , Sheena , Queen of the Jungle , and Joe Palooka . Original juvenile adventure series included Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion , Cowboy G - Men , and Ramar of the Jungle . Series based on literary properties included Sherlock Holmes , Long John Silver ( based on Treasure Island ) , and The Three Musketeers . Several of these were co-productions between U.S. and European ( usually British ) companies . Crusader Rabbit pioneered in the area of first - run animated series ; followed by Bucky and Pepito , Colonel Bleep , Spunky and Tadpole , Q.T. Hush , and others . ( All of these were five - minute shorts designed to be placed within locally hosted kiddie shows . ) Syndicated sports programming included Championship Bowling and All - Star Golf , both produced by Chicago - based Walter Schwimmer , Inc .   In addition to regular series , syndicators also offered packages of feature films , cartoons , and short subjects originally made for movie theatres . Until late in the 1950s , however , much of the theatrical product available consisted of low - budget secondary features ( mainly Westerns ) with relatively few notable stars . One syndication company , National Telefilm Associates , attempted to create a `` film network '' of stations showing its lineup of first - run series , which included syndicated programs such as Police Call ( 1955 ) , How to Marry a Millionaire ( 1957 - 1959 ) , The Passerby , Man Without a Gun ( 1957 - 1959 ) , and This is Alice ( 1958 ) . The venture lasted five years and closed down in 1961 .   By the late 1960s , a de facto two - tiered system had developed in the United States , with the major network affiliates ( usually on longer - range VHF stations ) consistently were drawing more viewers than their UHF , independent counterparts ; syndicators thus hoped to get their programs onto the major network stations , where spots in the lineup were far more scarce . FCC rulings in 1971 curtailed the U.S. networks ' ability to schedule programming in what has become known as the `` early fringe '' , notably the 7 -- 8 p.m. ( Eastern and Pacific Time ) hour of `` prime time '' , with the stated hope that this might encourage more local programming of social and cultural relevance to communities ( off - network syndicated repeats were also banned ) ; some projects of this sort came to fruition , though usually relatively commercial and slick ones such as Group W 's Evening Magazine / PM Magazine franchise , and such pre-existing national projects as the brief commercial - television run of William F. Buckley , Jr. 's interview / debate series Firing Line . The more obvious result was an increase in Canadian - produced syndicated dramatic series , such as Dusty 's Trail and the Colgate - sponsored Dr. Simon Locke . Game shows , often evening editions of network afternoon series , flourished , and a few odd items such as Wild Kingdom , canceled by NBC in 1971 , had a continuing life as syndicated programming tailor - made for the early fringe .   1970s and 1980s ( edit )   In 1971 , the U.S. Federal Communications Commission passed the Prime Time Access Rule and Financial Interest and Syndication Rules , which prevented networks from programming one particular hour of prime time programming on its television stations each night and required the networks to spin off their syndication arms as independent companies . Although the intent of the rule was to encourage local stations to produce their own programs for this time slot , budgetary limits instead prompted stations to buy syndicated programs to fill the slot . This , coupled with an increase in UHF independent stations , caused a boom in the syndication market . In the 1970s , first - run syndication continued to be an odd mix : cheaply produced , but not always poor quality , `` filler '' programming . These included the dance - music show Soul Train , and 20th Century Fox 's That 's Hollywood , a television variation on the popular That 's Entertainment ! theatrically released collections of film clips from the Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer library .   There were also many imported programs distributed this way . These include the documentary series Wild , Wild World of Animals ( repackaged by Time - Life with narration by William Conrad ) and Thames Television 's sober and necessarily grim The World at War . The Starlost ( 1973 ) was a Canadian series , apparently modified from the vision of science fiction writers Harlan Ellison and Ben Bova . Britain 's ITC Entertainment , headed by Lew Grade , made UFO ( 1970 ) and Space : 1999 ( 1975 ) . These two series were created by Gerry Anderson ( and his associates ) , who was previously best known for Supermarionation ( a combination of puppetry and animation ) series such as Thunderbirds . The most successful syndicated show in the United States in the 1970s was probably The Muppet Show , also from Lew Grade 's company . Animated series from the 1980s Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds and Around the World with Willy Fog came from Spanish animation production company BRB Internacional and their Japanese co-producers Nippon Animation .   Game shows thrived in syndication during the decade . Nightly versions of What 's My Line ? , Truth or Consequences , Beat the Clock and To Tell the Truth premiered in the late 1960s and found loyal audiences for many years . Several daytime network games began producing once - a-week nighttime versions for broadcast in the early evening hours , usually with bigger prizes and often featuring different hosts ( emcees were limited to appearing on one network and one syndicated game simultaneously ) and modified titles ( Match Game PM , The $100,000 Name That Tune or The $25,000 Pyramid , for example ) . A few independent game shows , such as Sports Challenge and Celebrity Bowling , also entered the syndication market around this time . Of these shows , Let 's Make a Deal and Hollywood Squares were the first to jump to twice - a-week syndicated versions around 1973 . Another popular daytime show to have a weekly syndicated version was The Price Is Right , which began concurrently in weekly syndication and on CBS ; the syndicated `` nighttime '' version was hosted by Dennis James for its first five years , after which daytime host Bob Barker took over for another three years of weekly episodes ( even though , by this point , the daytime and nighttime shows had diverged noticeably ) . The nighttime version of Family Feud ( 1977 ) quickly jumped from once - weekly to twice , and finally to five - day - a-week airings , and its massive popularity , along with that of new five - day - a-week entries like Jack Barry 's The Joker 's Wild ( 1977 ) and Tic - Tac - Dough ( 1978 ) and Chuck Barris 's increasingly raunchy remakes of his 1960s hits The Newlywed Game and The Dating Game , brought an end ( with rare exceptions ) to the era of once - a-week games . Also popular in first - run syndication and daytime was The Gong Show , hosted by Barris throughout most of its run ( Gary Owens hosted the first syndicated season ) .   A number of half - hour musical - variety shows were also offered in the early 1970s , generally built around personable middle - of - the - road singers like Bobby Vinton , Bobby Goldsboro , Dolly Parton , and Andy Williams , or groups like Sha Na Na , The Johnny Mann Singers , and The Golddiggers . Wait Till Your Father Gets Home ( 1972 ) was a Hanna - Barbera cartoon series attempting to ape the All in the Family - style sitcoms ; Skippy the Bush Kangaroo ( 1969 ) , an Australian children 's series , or Gentle Ben ( a decade later , the decidedly not - for - children Australian Prisoner : Cell Block H would have a brief U.S. syndicated run ) ; and a Canadian sketch - comedy series began appearing on U.S. television stations in 1977 -- Second City Television , which would eventually find a home , for two seasons , on NBC , as SCTV Network 90 ( and on premium cable channel Cinemax by 1983 ) .   The Universal / Paramount - produced package of original programming , Operation Prime Time , began appearing on ad hoc quasi-networks of ( almost by necessity ) non-network stations in the U.S. in 1978 , with a mini-series adaptation of John Jakes 's The Bastard . From the later 1960s into the late 1970s , Westinghouse also found considerable success with The Mike Douglas Show , a variety / talk show hosted by a singer with an easygoing interview style , which aired in the afternoons in most markets ; similar programs soon followed featuring Merv Griffin , who had been the host of CBS ' most sustained late - night answer to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson previously , and another network veteran , Dinah Shore . Also notable was the growing success of audience - participation talk shows , particularly that of the innovator of the format , Phil Donahue .   First - run syndication in the 1970s also made it possible for some shows that were no longer wanted by television networks to remain on the air . In 1971 , ABC canceled The Lawrence Welk Show , which went on to produce new episodes in syndication for another 11 years , and currently continues to much success in weekend reruns ( with new segments featuring Welk cast members inserted within the episodes ) distributed to PBS stations by the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority . Also in 1971 , CBS dropped Lassie and Hee Haw , the latter show 's run ending as part of the network 's cancellation of all of its rural - oriented shows ( known then as `` rural purge '' , which also resulted in the cancellations of The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres ) . Lassie entered first - run syndication for two years , while Hee Haw continued to produce new episodes until 1992 .  First - run syndicated comedy ( edit ) Main article : List of sitcoms broadcast in first - run syndication  Throughout the mid-to - late 1980s into the early 1990s , sitcoms continued to enter first - run syndication after being canceled by the networks , the most successful of which were Mama 's Family and Charles In Charge . Other sitcoms during this time to enter first - run syndication after network cancellation included Silver Spoons , Punky Brewster , Webster , It 's a Living , Too Close for Comfort , 9 to 5 , What 's Happening ! ! , and WKRP in Cincinnati . Many of these sitcoms produced new shows in syndication mainly to have enough episodes for a profitable run in reruns . Other sitcoms , such as Small Wonder , Out of This World , The Munsters Today , and Harry and the Hendersons ( as well as more action - adventure oriented series like Superboy and My Secret Identity ) enjoyed success in syndication throughout their entire run .  Dramatic first - run syndicated programs ( edit )  The broadcast networks aired many action - adventure programs from the 1950s to the 1980s . By the late 1980s , however , increasing production costs made them less attractive to the networks . Studios found that reruns of one - hour dramas did not sell as well as sitcoms , so they were unable to fully recoup the shows ' costs using the traditional deficit financing model . When NBC canceled the television series adaptation of Fame after only two seasons , the producers made special arrangements with LBS Communications , which resulted in MGM reviving the series for first - run syndication in the fall of 1983 , where it continued for four more seasons , with the last first - run episode airing in the U.S. on May 18 , 1987 .   Star Trek : The Next Generation debuted in 1987 , and became the most - watched syndicated show throughout its seven - year run . Its great success caused many others to debut . Friday the 13th : The Series ( a horror series which shared its title with the successful movie franchise ) also debuted in 1987 . The next syndicated shows that debuted in 1988 were War of the Worlds and Freddy 's Nightmares . Baywatch , which debuted in 1989 on NBC and was canceled after one season also became one of the most watched syndicated shows throughout its ten - year - run , garnering a worldwide audience .   By 1994 , there were more than 20 one - hour syndicated shows . Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Renegade were also syndicated . Hercules : The Legendary Journeys and its spin - off series Xena : Warrior Princess were also popular , often tying Deep Space Nine at 5 % to 6 % of the Nielsen - monitored audience . Forever Knight drew devoted `` cult '' audiences ( 3 % rating ) . Psi Factor and Poltergeist : The Legacy attempted to draw on the audience for the Fox series The X-Files ( as did the short - lived spinoff Baywatch Nights ) . Among the other series were Relic Hunter , VIP , High Tide , She Spies and Once a Thief .   Babylon 5 began life in 1993 on the Prime Time Entertainment Network ( PTEN ) , moved into syndicated distribution when its network was displaced by WB / UPN - affiliated stations , and eventually ended its final season on TNT ( 1998 ) . In 1997 Earth : Final Conflict , based on ideas from Gene Roddenberry , premiered in syndication . Three years later , a second Gene Roddenberry series , Andromeda also premiered in syndication . As emerging networks WB and UPN signed contracts with formerly - independent stations , and the syndication market shrunk , Andromeda season 5 moved to the Syfy Channel ( 2004 ) .   There would not be a first - run syndicated drama ( or a first - run scripted series in syndication ) until 2008 , when Disney - ABC Domestic Television and ABC Studios teamed up with Sam Raimi to launch a new first - run syndicated series , Legend of the Seeker , based on Terry Goodkind 's Sword of Truth novel series . Another gap in first - run scripted series in syndication followed for four years after Legend of the Seeker was canceled in 2009 , until Trifecta Entertainment & Media ( a company that mainly distributes programs for off - network syndication ) began producing SAF3 ( pronounced `` safe '' ) in 2013 .  Animated series ( edit ) Main articles : List of animated television series created for syndication and Weekday cartoon  During the late 1970s and 1980s , independent stations signed on in mid-sized and many small markets . The market for made - for - television cartoons grew as a result to include a branch for such stations . It usually had a greater artistic freedom , and looser standards ( not mandated by a network ) . The older Bugs Bunny and Popeye cartoons made way for first - run syndicated cartoons such as He - Man and the Masters of the Universe , Inspector Gadget , ThunderCats , My Little Pony , The Transformers , G.I. Joe , Voltron , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , and reruns of Scooby - Doo , Garfield and Friends , and The Pink Panther , among many others .   In 1987 , The Walt Disney Company tried its luck at syndication ; DuckTales premiered that September and would eventually last for 100 episodes . The success of DuckTales paved the way for a second series two years later , Chip ' n Dale Rescue Rangers . The following year , the two shows aired together under the umbrella block The Disney Afternoon . In the fall of 1990 , Disney added another hour to The Disney Afternoon ; the block continued in syndication , running additional first - run animated series until 1999 .   These cartoons initially competed with the ones that were nationally televised on the broadcast networks . In the 1980s , national broadcast networks only aired cartoons on Saturday mornings , not competing with the weekday and Sunday syndication blocks aired by local independent stations ; however , by the 1990s , Fox and then The WB launched their own weekday afternoon children 's program blocks . By the end of the 1990s , both syndication distributors and broadcast networks ended up losing most of its children 's market to the rise of cable television channels aimed at that audience such as Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network , which provided appealing children 's entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours .   Syndication remains a method of choice for distributing children 's programming , although this has gradually shifted to only produce programs to satisfy the federally mandated `` educational - informational '' ( E / I ) rule imposed in the late 1990s as part of an amendment to the Children 's Television Act of 1990 that requires stations to air three hours of educational children 's programs every week , regardless of the station 's format . Syndication is generally a less expensive option for a local station than to attempt to produce its own locally originated E / I programming ; not all networks provide their own E / I programs , so stations that are affiliated with networks that do not carry children 's program blocks acquire E / I programs off the syndication market to fulfill the requirements .  News programming and late - night talk shows ( edit )  Also in the 1980s , news programming of various sorts began to be offered widely to stations . Independent Network News , which was produced by WPIX in New York City , was a half - hour nightly program that ran from 1980 to 1990 on independent stations ( in some markets , INN was paired with a locally produced primetime newscast ) ; CNN would offer a simulcast of programming from its sister network Headline News ( now HLN ) to broadcast stations later , though it was used mainly to fill overnight time periods and was effectively discontinued in syndication with the 2006 launch of that network 's `` Headline Prime '' talk show block . Entertainment Tonight began its long and continuing run as a `` soft '' news daily strip , with a number of imitations following ( among which have included such entertainment news shows as TMZ on TV , Extra and ET 's own spin - off The Insider ) ; and `` tabloid '' television , in the wake of ABC 's 20 / 20 and , more immediately , 20th Television 's A Current Affair , would become a syndication staple with such series as Hard Copy and Real TV .   Another area where network dominance was challenged by syndicated programming in the 1980s was with late - night talk shows ; The Arsenio Hall Show was the only very successful one ( it would be canceled after five years in 1994 due to ratings declines spurred by many CBS affiliates pushing the show to later timeslots following the debut of the Late Show with David Letterman , and was later revived in 2013 ) , but similar programs were attempted such as Alan Thicke 's earlier short - lived Thicke of the Night , Lauren Hutton 's innovatively shot Lauren Hutton and ... , and talk shows hosted by Dennis Miller , Whoopi Goldberg , David Brenner and Keenen Ivory Wayans ; Magic Johnson 's The Magic Hour was seen as a massive flop , similar to Thicke of the Night . The popularity of syndicated talk shows fell dramatically in the mid-1990s as network and cable offerings expanded in the wake of Johnny Carson 's retirement .  Reality and live - action children 's shows ( edit )  Long before their popularity on network television from the 2000s onward , reality competition shows in one form or another , such as Star Search and American Gladiators , enjoyed popularity in syndication as early as the mid-1980s . Since the now - defunct networks UPN and The WB began offering their affiliates additional nights of prime time programming in the late 1990s , there have been fewer first - run scripted series in syndication , at least , in the U.S. ; much as with the closing of windows that provided opportunity for Ziv in the 1950s and various producers in the early 1970s . The more expensive dramatic projects are less attractive to syndicators ( particularly when they might be sold , with somewhat less risk , to cable channels ) ; `` reality '' series such as Cheaters and Maximum Exposure and several dating series began to be more common in the early 2000s . Some of the more low - key programs in this category were designed to appeal to children , such as Beakman 's World , Disney 's Sing Me A Story with Belle , Animal Rescue and Jack Hanna 's Animal Adventures . They were able to get significant clearance because of stricter Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) enforcement of rules on children 's television programming .  Game shows ( edit )  Several game shows are currently syndicated ; historically , the most popular has been Wheel of Fortune and the current version of Jeopardy ! , both created by television personality Merv Griffin , respectively premiering in 1983 and 1984 . The shows have been # 1 and # 2 or # 1 to # 3 in the syndication ratings consistently since at least the late 1980s . In fact , according to the Guinness Book of World Records , Wheel is the most popular syndicated television program both within and outside the United States . Family Feud ended its first syndication run in 1985 . Three years later , a revival of the program featuring Ray Combs as host became a moderate hit and continued for seven seasons , its last year featuring the return of original host Richard Dawson in a failed attempt to save the series . A third revival hit the airwaves in 1999 and has gone through four hosts . The first three hosts ( Louie Anderson , Richard Karn and John O'Hurley ) struggled in their respective runs and only lasted three to four years . The current run of the program , hosted by Steve Harvey , has been a major ratings success ; on the week of June 12 , 2015 , for the first time ever , Family Feud was the highest - rated syndicated program in terms of average household ratings . A Hollywood Squares revival also thrived beginning in 1998 , running six seasons until its 2004 cancellation . By far the most successful entry into the market in the 2000s has been the daily version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , which premiered in 2002 .   Because game shows are very inexpensive to produce , with many episodes completed each day of production , successful ones are very profitable ; for example , in 1988 Jeopardy ! cost an estimated $5 million to produce but earned almost $50 million in revenue . New game show concepts ( that is , not based on an existing or pre-existing format ) are rarely tried and usually unsuccessful in syndication ; somewhat of an exception to this was Street Smarts , which lasted from 2001 to 2006 ( despite the series airing in late night slots in many markets ) . Between 2003 and 2007 , no new game shows debuted in syndication , marking four consecutive seasons where no new shows with that genre debuted , a syndication first . That streak ended with the fall 2007 debuts of Temptation and Merv Griffin 's Crosswords , bringing the daytime tally to six game shows ; both ended production after one year , though Crosswords aired in reruns in some cities during the 2008 -- 09 season before those reruns moved exclusively to cable .   More new shows were added for the 2008 -- 09 fall season , including a daytime run of Deal or No Deal ( which featured certain elements that differed from the show 's franchised format , most notably with prospective players instead of models holding briefcases that held the monetary amounts ) and an adaptation of the popular board game Trivial Pursuit . While Deal caught on and was renewed for the 2009 -- 2010 season , Trivial Pursuit : America Plays suffered low ratings throughout its run and was canceled .   For the 2009 -- 2010 season , the Fox game show Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader ? moved to syndication with a new , less expensive format . Do n't Forget the Lyrics ! followed for the 2010 -- 2011 season . Deal , suffering from falling ratings , was canceled in February 2010 , with the final episodes airing in late May of that same year . 5th Grader and Do n't Forget the Lyrics were canceled the following year for the same reason ( although reruns of 5th Grader remain on cable ) . Reruns of the popular Discovery Channel show Cash Cab began airing in syndication in January 2011 . Reruns of the GSN dating game show Baggage first aired in syndication as a test run in early 2011 on stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group , which preceded its full launch into other markets in fall 2012 ; although it was removed from syndication after one season .   The 2014 - 15 season saw the introduction of Celebrity Name Game , hosted by former The Late Late Show host Craig Ferguson ; the series was renewed for a second season in January 2015 , while Ferguson would also win a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host for his work on the program . In January 2016 , Fox owned - and - operated stations began a test run of South of Wilshire -- a game show produced by TMZ . The 2017 summer season includes the game show `` iWitness '' created by TV judge Judith Sheindlin .  Stripped talk shows ( edit )  The dominant form of first - run syndication in the U.S. for the last three decades has been the `` stripped '' ( or `` strip '' ) talk show , such as Donahue , Oprah Winfrey , The Tyra Banks Show , and The Jerry Springer Show . Strip programming is a technique used for scheduling television and radio programming to ensure consistency and coherency . Strip programming is used to deliver consistent content to targeted audiences . Broadcasters know or predict the times at which certain demographics will be listening to or watching their programs and play them at that time . As with game shows , talk shows are inexpensive to produce and very profitable if successful . In many markets , a stripped show will be seen twice daily , usually with different episodes ( one being a more recent episode and the other being an episode from a previous season ) . Sometimes , station groups with more than one station in a market , or a `` duopoly '' , will run one episode of a strip on one of their stations in the morning , and the other available episode on another of their stations that night .   Meanwhile , the popularity of some of the audience - participation talk shows continues to encourage new participants , some of whom , such as Morton Downey , Jr. and Rosie O'Donnell , have brief periods of impressive ratings and influence ; others , such as Oprah Winfrey and Maury Povich , have a sustained run . A notable scheduling decision was made by KRON - TV in San Francisco : a 2000 dispute with NBC led to that station 's disaffiliation from that network after 52 years , and since all the other larger networks were already represented in San Francisco , KRON decided to become one of the largest commercial independent stations by market size on the VHF band in the U.S. , and soon tried running Dr. Phil , a popular new stripped series hosted by Winfrey - associate Phil McGraw , in primetime , with impressive ratings results .   2000s ( edit )  Main article : First - run syndication in the United States , 2000s  First - run syndicated shows in the United States include talk shows ( e.g. , The Dr. Oz Show , Dr. Phil and The Ellen DeGeneres Show ) ; tabloid / newsmagazine shows ( e.g. , TMZ Live ) ; crime / law enforcement shows ( e.g. , Crime Watch Daily ) ; game shows ( e.g. , Family Feud , Jeopardy ! and Wheel of Fortune ) ; reality court shows ( e.g. , Judge Judy ) ; and sitcoms ( e.g. , The First Family ) .   Influence on television schedules ( edit )   In earlier times , independent stations thrived on syndicated programming , including some venerable and quite profitable stations such as KMSP - TV in the Minneapolis - St. Paul market . With the loosening of FCC regulations and the creation of new additional broadcast networks ( such as Fox , The CW , MyNetworkTV and Ion Television ) , most of these independents have joined one or another of these or smaller ( religious or low - budget ) networks .   In another case , like those of KCAL - TV in Los Angeles , KMCI - TV in Lawrence - Kansas City and WMLW - TV in Racine - Milwaukee , those independent stations are used to complement their network - affiliated sister station ( respectively in the mentioned cases , KCBS - TV , KSHB - TV and WDJT - TV ) by allowing a duopoly control of more syndicated programming than would be possible on one station ( and to spread it throughout the schedule of the two stations , often several times a day ) , or to air news programming in times unavailable on the larger network station , along with fulfilling network and syndicated programming commitments , which allows popular or network programming to be moved to the independent stations due to breaking news or sports commitments without the traditional inconvenience of a late night or weekend airing of the pre-empted show . A duopoly of a network - affiliated and independent station also allows a network station to move a low - rated syndicated program to their sister independent station to stem revenue losses .   Off - network syndication ( edit )   Off - network syndication occurs when a network television show is syndicated in packages containing some or all episodes , and sold to as many television stations and markets as possible to be used in local programming timeslots . In this manner , sitcoms are preferred and more successful because they are less serialized , and can be run non-sequentially , which is more beneficial and less costly for the station . In the United States , local stations now rarely broadcast reruns of primetime dramas ( or simply air them primarily on weekends ) ; instead , they usually air on basic cable channels , which may air each episode 30 to 60 times .   Syndication rights typically last for six consecutive showings of a series within three to five years ; if a program continues to perform well enough in broadcast or cable syndication during the initial cycle , television stations or cable networks can opt to renew an off - network program for an additional cycle .   Syndication has been known to spur the popularity of a series that only experienced moderate success during its network run . The best known example of this is the original series of Star Trek , which ran for three seasons on NBC from 1966 to 1969 , gaining only modest ratings , but became a worldwide phenomenon after it entered off - network syndication . Its success in syndication led to the Star Trek film series , Star Trek : The Next Generation , and the later versions in the franchise .   It is common for long - running series to have early seasons syndicated while the series itself is still in first - run network production . In order to differentiate between new and rebroadcast content , until the 1980s it was not uncommon for series to be syndicated under a different title than that used in their original broadcast run . Examples include Bonanza ( which was syndicated as Ponderosa ) , Gunsmoke ( as Marshall Dillon , a title still used to differentiate reruns from the early , half - hour and black - and - white episodes of the show from the later one - hour color episodes ) , Emergency ! ( as Emergency One ) , Ironside ( as The Raymond Burr Show ) , Hawaii Five - O ( as McGarrett ) , M * A * S * H ( as M * A * S * H 4077th ) , Marcus Welby , M.D. ( as Robert Young , Family Doctor ) , CHiPs ( as CHiPs Patrol ) , and Happy Days ( as Happy Days Again ) .   Syndication of older episodes can also increase exposure for a television show that is still airing first - run network episodes . In the case of the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory , its syndication , particularly on TBS , is one of the reasons attributed for a rise in first - run ratings for its sixth season . The sixth - season episode `` The Bakersfield Expedition '' , for example , was the first episode of that series to attract 20 million viewers .   Strip / daily syndication ( edit )   Off - network syndication can take several forms . The most common form is known as strip syndication or daily syndication , when episodes of a television series are shown daily five times a week in the same time slot . In the 1960s and 1970s , independent stations with no news departments began viewing strip syndication as a necessary means of obtaining effective counterprogramming to the local news programs airing on network affiliates . Typically , this means that enough episodes must exist ( 88 episodes , or four seasons , is the usual minimum , though many syndicators prefer a fully rounded 100 episodes ) to allow for continual strip syndication to take place over the course of several months , without episodes being repeated . However , there are exceptions , such as the 65 - episode block ( common in children 's programming ) , which allows for a 13 - week cycle of daily showings , so there will only be four repeats in a year .   In some cases , more than one episode is shown daily . Half - hour sitcoms are sometimes syndicated in groups of two or four episodes , taking up one or two hours of broadcast time . If a series is not strip syndicated , it may be aired once a week , instead of five times a week . This allows shows with fewer episodes to last long in syndication , but it also may mean viewers will tire of waiting a week for the next episode of a show they have already seen and stop watching . More often , hour - long dramas in their first several runs in syndication are offered weekly ; sitcoms are more likely to get stripped . In recent years , there has been something of a trend toward showing two consecutive episodes of a program on Saturday and Sunday nights after prime time ( generally following the local news ) . This pattern has been particularly prominent for shows which are still in production but have run long enough to have many previous episodes available .   As with commercial stations , not all the airtime nor all the perceived audience are met by the productions offered U.S. public - broadcasting stations by PBS ; additionally , there are some independent public television stations in the U.S. which take no programming from that ( somewhat ) decentralized network . As a result , there are several syndicators of programming for the non-profit stations , several of which are descendants of the regional station groups which combined some , not all , of their functions into the creation of PBS in 1969 . American Public Television ( APT ) is the largest of these , nearly matched by the National Educational Telecommunications Association ( NETA ) ; similarly , the now defunct Continental Program Marketing was another of the syndicator - descendants ( of the Northeastern , Southeastern , and Rocky Mountain educational networks , respectively ) of the pre-PBS era . Among the other notable organizations in the U.S. are Westlink Satellite Operations ( based at Albuquerque 's KNME ) , BBC Worldwide Americas ( which often works with other distributors and individual stations , since it has no satellite access of its own in the U.S. ) , Deutsche Welle , Executive Program Services , the Program Resource Group and PBS 's Long Island , New York member station WLIW , which is ( with the arguable exception of KNME ) the most prolific contributor of any individual station of syndicated programming , most obviously the BBC World News , Doctor Who and Monty Python 's Flying Circus in the U.S.   Off - network syndication in its various forms , including Internet , international and traditional direct - to - station sales , constitute roughly half of an individual television program 's overall revenue stream , with the other half taken up by advertising .

Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information . ( August 2013 )     In 1993 , Universal Studios became one of the first studios to cash in on the cable trend , first selling repeats of Major Dad to USA Network in 1993 for $600,000 per episode , the first time a network program was exclusively sold to a cable network for its first run rights . Later it sold reruns of Law & Order to A&E for about $155,000 an episode ; in 1996 , the studio got $275,000 from USA Network for repeats of New York Undercover , a far less successful show . Law & Order drew A&E 's highest daytime ratings -- one million viewers per episode .   Universal sold reruns of Xena : Warrior Princess and Hercules : The Legendary Journeys to USA Network for $300,000 each . And even long - forgotten shows can find new life : The Nashville Network bought The Dukes of Hazzard from Warner Bros. in 1997 for well over $10 million . USA Network paid $750,000 for the rights to Walker , Texas Ranger ; while USA 's reruns of the show drew an average of 2.3 million viewers -- outstanding by cable standards -- Perth says the show will need an enormous number of airings to have any sort of profitability .

Less popular programming may be distributed by barter , in which the syndicator , instead of selling the show to a station , offers the show for free , with the caveat that the station give up its advertising time on other shows to the syndicator 's advertisers . Barter syndication , in addition to the cost advantage , is popular because of its flexibility ; a station can typically pick up a barter syndicated program for only a few weeks or months , without the long - term financial commitment of a traditional syndicated series , allowing the station to plug the show into its lineup to fill a hole in the schedule .   Types of deals ( edit )   Cash deals are when a distributor offers a syndicated program to the highest bidder . A cash plus deal is when the distributor retains advertising space to offset some of the cost for the program . The station gets the program for a little less in exchange for some ad space for the producer .   Barter deals are usually for new untested shows or older shows . In this type of deal , distributors get a fraction of the advertisement revenue in exchange for their program . For example , in a 7 / 5 deal the producer gets seven minutes of advertising time , leaving five minutes for the station to insert local as well as national advertisements .   Radio syndication ( edit )   Radio syndication generally works the same way as television syndication , except that radio stations usually are not organized into strict affiliate - only networks . Radio networks generally are only distributors of radio shows , and individual stations ( though often owned by large conglomerates ) decide which shows to carry from a wide variety of networks and independent radio providers . As a result , radio networks such as WestwoodOne or Premiere Networks , despite their influence in broadcasting , are not as recognized among the general public as television networks like CBS or ABC ( many of these distributors ally themselves with television networks ; WestwoodOne , for instance , is allied with NBC , while Premiere is allied with Fox ) . Some examples of widely syndicated commercial broadcasting music programs include weekly countdowns like Rick Dees ' Weekly Top 40 , the American Top 40 , American Country Countdown with Kix Brooks , Canada 's Top 20 Countdown , the Canadian Hit 30 Countdown and the nightly program , Delilah , heard on many U.S. stations .   Syndication is particularly popular in talk radio . While syndicated music shows ( with the exception of some evening and overnight shows such as Delilah mentioned above ) tend to air once a week and are mostly recorded , most popular talk radio programs are syndicated daily and are broadcast live . Also , with relatively few 24 - hour live talk radio networks ( though this , in recent times , has been changing ) , most radio stations are free to assemble their own lineup of talk show hosts as they so choose . Examples of syndicated talk programs are Premiere Networks ' The Bob & Tom Show , Dial Global 's The Jim Bohannon Show , and the self - syndicated The Dave Ramsey Show ( more recently , talk networks such as Talk Radio Network have been marketing and packaging all - day lineups , marking a departure from the syndication model ; as such , popular shows such as Cumulus Media Networks ' The Savage Nation and Premiere 's The Rush Limbaugh Show now air as part of a broader network lineup in many markets , particularly on Premiere owned - and - operated stations , though they continue to be syndicated to non-network stations as well ) . Talk syndication tends to be more prevalent because voice tracking , a practice used by many music stations to have disc jockeys host multiple supposedly local shows at once , is not feasible with live talk radio .   National Public Radio , Public Radio International , and American Public Media all sell programming to local member stations in the U.S. , most of which are subsidized through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting but operated by private nonprofit organizations , universities , state or local governments . This is in contrast to centralized public radio networks in other countries ( such as Canada 's CBC , Australia 's ABC and the United Kingdom 's BBC ) that own and operate all of their stations as arms of the national government and run them as a strict network ( from 1948 to 2013 , the United States had a strict anti-propaganda law , the Smith -- Mundt Act , that prohibited broadcasting government - owned networks such as Voice of America to American audiences . The law was mostly repealed in 2013 , but distribution of VOA or other federally produced radio programming is still rare ) . Two independently produced , non-commercial syndicated programs , heard on hundreds of community radio and indie radio stations , are Alternative Radio and Democracy Now ! . Some ( in fact , most ) radio programs are also offered on a barter system usually at no charge to the radio station . The system is used for live programming or preproduced programs and include a mixture of ad time sold by the program producer as well as time set aside for the radio station to sell .   History ( edit )   Before radio networks matured in the United States , some early radio shows were reproduced on transcription disks and mailed to individual stations . An example of syndication using this method was RadiOzark Enterprises , Inc. based in Springfield , Missouri , co-owned with KWTO . The Assembly of God , with national headquarters in Springfield , sponsored a half - hour program on the station called Sermons in Song . RadiOzark began transcribing the show for other stations in the 1940s , and eventually 200 stations carried the program . The company later produced country music programs starring among others , Smiley Burnette , George Morgan , Bill Ring and Tennessee Ernie Ford ( 260 15 - minute episodes of The Tennessee Ernie Show were distributed ) , and more than 1,200 U.S. and Canadian stations aired the programs . Many syndicated radio programs were distributed through the U.S. mail or another delivery service , although the medium changed as technology developed , going from transcription disks to phonograph records , tape recordings , cassette tapes and eventually CDs . Many smaller weekend programs still use this method to this day , though with the rise of the Internet , many stations have since opted to distribute programs via CD - quality MP3s through FTP downloads .   It was not until the advent of satellite communications in the 1980s that live syndication became popular ( though it could be transmitted through network lines , it was not particularly common because of cost , network congestion and quality issues ) . Since then , most syndicated radio programs are distributed using satellite subcarrier audio technology . Shortly after satellite networks such as RKO , Transtar and SMN began , the Fairness Doctrine was repealed , which is credited with helping Rush Limbaugh become the first national talk radio superstar . At the same time , the FCC began issuing more FM radio licenses to suburban and rural areas in the late 1980s , which allowed more room for music stations on the FM dial ; radio formats such as country music that were traditionally AM fixtures even after most pop and rock music moved to FM were now moving to FM as well , leaving much more room for talk formats on the AM dial . As the 1990s went on , Dr. Laura and Howard Stern began their national shows , rising to become national icons . The Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which led to significant concentration of media ownership , facilitated the rapid deployment of both existing and new syndicated programs in the late 1990s , putting syndication on par with , and eventually surpassing , the network radio format .   After the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , syndicated talk radio saw a notably rapid rise in popularity , as networks rushed new national shows into syndication to meet the demand for discussion of national issues . Many of these , such as Laura Ingraham , Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck , were mostly supportive of the actions of the Republican - led government ; a few others , such as Alex Jones , were openly critical of the government 's actions and motives . After the Democrats took control in the late 2000s , the gap between the two styles narrowed due to the mutual opposition of both camps to the government 's actions , which allowed Jones greater clearance on stations .   In contrast to conservative talk radio , which has predominantly been driven by syndication , progressive talk radio has almost always been a network - driven model . The incompatibility of conservative and progressive ideologies and the lack of syndicated progressive hosts required solutions that could produce all - day programming to individual stations . It was not until Air America Radio launched in 2004 that progressive talk would become viable ; though it failed several years later , Dial Global now carries a network slate that is carried on most progressive talk stations . Sports radio is likewise mostly a network phenomenon , partially because the irregular nature of sports pre-emptions makes having a full - time network to be able to cut into and join in progress at any time highly convenient . Syndicated radio is not as popular in other parts of the world . Canada has a few independently syndicated shows , but the bulk of syndicated content there comes from the United States , and the sum total of syndicated programming is far less than most American stations , as Canadian stations rely more heavily on local content . Most other countries still follow the network radio model .   International syndication ( edit )   Syndication also applies to international markets . Same language countries often syndicate programs to each other -- such as programs from the United Kingdom being syndicated to Australia and vice versa . Another example would be programs from the United Kingdom , Mexico , Brazil , and Argentina being syndicated to local television stations in the United States , and programs from the United States being syndicated elsewhere in the world . One of the best - known internationally syndicated television series has been The Muppet Show , which was produced by Grade 's English ITV franchise company ATV at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire , and was shown around the world , including the United States , where it aired in syndication ( including the owned - and - operated stations of CBS ) , and Canada , where CBC Television aired the show . The 1970s was a time when many British comedies , including The Benny Hill Show and Monty Python 's Flying Circus were syndicated to the United States and worldwide . Many soaps and long - running series are also successfully syndicated around the globe .   The television show CSI earned $1.6 million per episode in its first cycle in cable syndication . There were many different versions of the show making it an international success . It was already popular in the U.S. , so becoming a success internationally as well as within the U.S. made syndication sensible . Whether a series is produced in the U.S. or not is based on the economic value and potential viability of its sales internationally with the possibility of syndication .   Economic factors that influence production outside the U.S. play a major role in deciding if a television show will be syndicated , internally and internationally . International syndication has sustained a growing of prosperity and monetary value amongst the distributors who sell to them . Due to a rise in competition , syndicators have upheld high standards for different countries to buy the rights to distribute shows . During the 1990s poor ratings were common amongst syndicated shows , but distributors still made it possible for international competition to happen and buy U.S. shows . Colombian , Brazilian , Mexican and Venezuelan telenovelas are programmed throughout the Portuguese and Spanish - speaking world , and in many parts of India , China and Europe , while Turkish television drama is broadcast in the Balkans , some other European countries , Western and Central Asia and North Africa .   U.S. - style syndication internationally ( edit )   Because of the structural differences discussed above , there are presently very few areas where a true U.S. - style syndication model operates , whereby programs are sold on a per - area basis ( within a single country ) to local or regional stations with differing ( or no ) network affiliations . Canada was historically one of the few exceptions . Until the mid-1990s , television stations in Canada , like those in the U.S. , were typically run as separate local operations , with a small number of moderately sized ownership groups such as Baton , CanWest , WIC , and CHUM . Those stations that were affiliated with a national network , i.e. CBC or CTV , did not always receive a full schedule of programming from that network .   At this time , it was not uncommon for U.S. syndicators to treat Canada as an extension of their domestic syndication operations , for both their first - run and off - network offerings . This is still the case for American radio programs ; Canadian radio networks are not assembled as rigidly into networks ( except for the CBC 's radio division ) . However , an alternate form of first - run syndication was performed by some domestic broadcasters : as the Canadian rights to U.S. primetime series were often acquired by individual station groups ( as opposed to full - fledged national networks ) , they would in turn resell local rights for those programs to stations in areas where they did not operate . A few of Canada 's independent stations , most notably CHCH - TV and CITY - TV , also resyndicated their own locally produced programs to other television stations . Unlike in the United States , however , few Canadian programs were ever created solely for syndication without officially belonging to at least one specific station or network ; those that did exist were intended primarily to be syndicated into the American system , and even those were typically distributed in Canada as `` network '' programs rather than being sold to individual stations .   Since the late 1990s , as most stations have been consolidated into national networks consisting almost entirely of owned - and - operated stations and with full - day network schedules , both types of syndication have largely disappeared from the Canadian broadcast landscape . Programs that are sold in syndication in the U.S. are now generally sold to Canadian media groups to air across all their properties , with per - market sales now being very rare . For example , American shows that air in syndication in the United States , such as Live with Kelly and Ryan or The Ellen DeGeneres Show , air in Canada as core parts of the CTV Television Network schedule . The Oprah Winfrey Show appears to have been the last significant holdout to this model , having aired primarily on CTV stations , but in some markets airing instead on a Global station , and even some CBC affiliates .   One syndication service remains in Canada , yes TV , which serves the few remaining independent stations in the country with mostly American programs ( Judge Judy , Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy ! are currently syndicated in Canada through yes TV ) . These independent stations can also secure deals with American syndicators ; CHCH , for example , has a direct deal with 20th Television to carry some of that company 's classic sitcoms , including those from the MTM Enterprises library .   Regional syndication ( edit )   There are three key reasons why a radio station will decide to pick up a syndicated show -- the program is unique and difficult to replicate content , has a decent ratings track record , and whether or not it has a celebrity host . New developing radio programs are generally able to claim one of these attributes , but not all three . Regional syndication attempts to replace these benchmark attributes with other benefits that are generally recognized by the industry as also being important . Given the financial downturn within the industry , the need for quality cost effective locally relevant programming is greater than ever before . Programs that offer regionally specific content while providing the economic benefits of syndication can be especially appealing to potential affiliates . Regional syndication can also be more attractive to area advertisers who share a common regional trading area versus assembling a radio network of stations that hopscotch across the United States .

Prize   The last remaining House Guest is set to receive a prize of $500,000 .   Main twists   This season 's main theme and twists centered on technology .  BB App Store  For the first three weeks , viewers were asked a series of questions about their opinions on the remaining House Guests . The House Guest who was named in the most overall answers was deemed the `` top trending '' House Guest of the week and earned a `` Power App '' , which would give them an advantage in the game , while the House Guest who was answered the least was deemed `` least trending '' was given a `` Crap App '' , which gave them a punishment . Once HouseGuests received an app , they were no longer eligible to receive one in the future .     Week   Top trending   Power App   Least trending   Crap App   Punishment     Name   Ability   Status       Sam   Bonus Life   To be used immediately after a HouseGuest is evicted from the house , this power will give that House Guest a chance to return to the game via a competition . This power must be used in the first three evictions , or else the fourth evicted House Guest will automatically be given the chance to return .   Used ( by default )   Faysal   Hamazon   The House Guest will routinely be given packages of ham , which they must consume on arrival . ( As Faysal is Muslim , a vegetarian ham substitute was used instead . )       Tyler   The Cloud   The House Guest has the power to make themselves immune from nomination during one Nomination or Veto Ceremony of their choice over the following eight weeks .   Not used   Rachel   Yell !   For 24 hours , an angry reviewer was unleashed into the house at random times to loudly give the House Guest feedback on their game .       Bayleigh   Identity Theft   The House Guest can secretly replace the HoH 's nominations with two of their own . This does not affect replacement nominations and can be used until eight players remain .   Not used   Haleigh   Read It !   Periodically throughout the week , the House Guest must wear a costume and read Hamlet in a Shakespearean accent . This punishment will continue until the entire play has been read .    H@cker competition  On Day 44 , following Rachel 's eviction , a new twist was unleashed on the HouseGuests called the `` H@cker Competition '' . It lets one HouseGuest hack the game for a week . After the nominations , all of the HouseGuests compete in a competition at the same time in different rooms , making the winner anonymous to the other HouseGuests . The winner of the competition is able to `` hack '' the game in three different ways . First , they can replace one of the Head of Household 's nominations and change it to someone of their choosing . Second , they get to select one of the three participants chosen for the Power of Veto competition . Finally , they can nullify one vote at the live eviction .

Controversies and criticisms   Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix received criticism after he was shown using an ice cream scooper on the genitals of his other HouseGuests . Mounduix later told fellow HouseGuest Kaycee Clark to open up her vagina , saying it `` feels good '' .   Viewers questioned Angela Rummans and Rachel Swindler after they were caught on the live feeds making racist remarks , referencing fellow HouseGuest , Bayleigh Dayton . Rummans called her tan `` ghetto '' , while Swindler compared her skin tone to Dayton 's , who is African American . CBS later released a statement and warned Rummans and Swindler with future consequences .   Since the start of the live feeds , Kaitlyn Herman has been criticized from viewers for her feelings and actions towards several men in the Big Brother House , while being in a 5 - year relationship outside of the house . In Week 3 , Herman 's then - boyfriend released a statement on Twitter , stating that he wanted to distance himself from the show and situation .   Kaitlyn Herman and Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix both came under fire after they used the n - word in separate occasions . Herman used the word as she was singing the lyrics of a Drake song . Mounduix used the word after fellow HouseGuest Bayleigh Dayton , who is African American , asked Mounduix if there is a `` difference between a midget and a dwarf '' . Offended , Mounduix said that the word `` midget '' is a derogatory term and then compared it to the n - word . Many came to the defense of the two , saying that they did n't use the word towards someone . Herman later apologized for using the word on an Instagram live stream .   During a live eviction episode , HouseGuest Brett Robinson called out Angela `` Rockstar '' Lantry in his eviction speech for `` strategic purposes '' . Lantry responded by confronting Robinson in his face claiming that it was her daughter 's birthday . Lantry later called Robinson a `` rich , snobby , white - privileged - ass dude '' . Later that night , Lantry confronted Robinson with pots and pans during which she exclaimed that Robinson has a `` micropenis '' . Upon confrontation , Lantry sat between Robinson 's legs whom repeatedly asked her to get off of him .   Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix was criticized by fans after he asked Rachel Swindler if she was transgender , stating that she has `` a big Adam 's apple . '' Mounduix proceeded to feel Swindler 's neck , but she told him to stop . Moments later , he began to touch Swindler 's neck again before being stopped by her .   Viewers perceived some of Bayleigh Dayton 's comments about Faysal Shafaat as being anti-Muslim . After Shafaat , a Muslim , complained about his in - house crush Haleigh Broucher talking about her past sexual experiences , Dayton claimed in private that Shafaat should `` go find a virgin '' and that he should `` go to Pakistan and ( get himself ) one '' because `` that 's what they do . '' Many viewers interpreted `` they '' as meaning Muslims .   During a conversation between Dayton and Lantry , Dayton claimed that Lantry was the only white person who she knew that did n't like white people . Dayton then said that Lantry dislikes `` normal white people '' more than she does . Days later , in a conversation with Haleigh Broucher , Dayton referred to her housemates as `` crazy - ass white people . '' Many viewers saw Dayton 's statements as racist .   Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix was criticized by both fans and his fellow housemates for making light of the # MeToo movement after making jokes at the movement 's expense .   Joseph Charles `` JC '' Mounduix was once again involved in two separate sexual misconduct incidents in which he was accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault . While sleeping in the same bed , Mounduix was seen caressing Tyler Crispen 's arm , face , and chest , as well as kissing his armpit while Crispen was sleeping . The following morning Crispen stated to Kaycee Clark `` I 'm sleeping alone tonight -- JC is not sleeping with me '' . Mounduix explained his version by stating that he was `` comforting Crispen who was having nightmares '' . Later , Mounduix opened the toilet door while HouseGuest Haleigh Broucher was using it . Broucher repeatedly asked Mounduix to close the door whom refused and tied the door open . Broucher then yelled for assistance from production and later filed a complaint with executive producer Allison Grodner . The producers later released a statement saying that neither Crispen nor Broucher filed official complaints and that the two had expressed to them that they `` did not feel threatened or unsafe by Mounduix 's actions . ''   During a live eviction speech , HouseGuest Scottie Salton made sexual and vulgar comments towards HouseGuests Tyler Crispen and Angela Rummans . He hinted that Crispen received oral sex from Rummans , which got censored out by CBS .   Haleigh Broucher was criticized by both fans and her fellow houseguests after making a joke about disabled people . During a conversation with Tyler Crispen and Joseph `` JC '' Mounduix , Broucher opened a fortune cookie that read , `` Nothing can stop you from reaching your goals . '' After reading the quote , she responded by saying `` That is not true because if you are paralyzed , you can not reach anything . '' Crispen was quick to call her out , telling Broucher that it was `` the worst thing ( he had ) ever heard ( her ) say '' . Crispen then told Broucher that she needed `` to rephrase '' what she had just said , to which Mounduix added that he had seen disabled people achieve their goals .   On finale night , Swaggy C , proposed to contestant Bayleigh Dayton . This sparked controversy among rumours that she got pregnant while in the Big Brother House . They later confirmed in a video that while in the house , Bayleigh did get pregnant but she suffered a miscarriage .

Uncertain future   The American adaptation of Big Brother has aired on CBS since its inception on July 5 , 2000 with Julie Chen as host . Following two articles published by The New Yorker by Ronan Farrow in July and September 2018 where several women accused Chen 's husband Les Moonves of harassment , intimidation , and sexual misconduct , effective September 9 , 2018 , Moonves departed CBS Corporation as President , Chairman and CEO with Joseph Ianniello appointed as President and Acting CEO . In response to the claims against him , Moonves released a statement denying the allegations . After the first article was published , Chen released a statement on Twitter in July defending her husband .   While Chen was initially confirmed to return to the ninth season of her other CBS show The Talk , she was absent from the season premiere that aired on September 10 , 2018 . Chen issued a statement where she was taking a few days off , but would continue with Big Brother . Chen 's first television appearance since Moonves ' departure was the live eviction on September 13 , 2018 , where she closed out the episode with `` From outside the Big Brother house ... I 'm Julie Chen Moonves , good night . '' The new sign - off broke with an established pattern that Chen has used in the past on Big Brother and showcased her support for her husband , while it received a mix response from fans and viewers on Twitter . Chen subsequently announced her departure from The Talk in a pre-recorded segment that aired on the September 18 , 2018 episode where she stood outside the Big Brother house . Chen will continue to host Big Brother .   The twentieth season had been confirmed since August 10 , 2016 as part of a two - year renewal between CBS and Fly on the Wall Entertainment , in association with Endemol Shine North America . Celebrity Big Brother was renewed for a second season on May 12 , 2018 during CBS ' annual upfront for the 2018 -- 19 television season . Speculation on the status of the show intensified after the departure of Moonves from CBS , with fans of the show and former HouseGuests began spreading the hashtag # SaveBBUSA in an attempt to get the program renewed . Unnamed insiders close to the production of the show have cast doubt if Chen would return to host potential future installments if CBS renews the show . In an article from US Weekly , an insider noted that former HouseGuests Will Kirby , Ross Mathews , and Big Brother Canada host Arisa Cox have been mentioned as potential replacements in the event that Chen does not to return , while TMZ reported that Chen will continue with the show if the network decides to renew it .   However , despite the show 's uncertain future , CBS began accepting online applications for a twenty - first season on September 20 , 2018 .

Against the orders of Vince , who now leads The Right Arm resistance , the three leave their camp to rescue their immune friend Minho , who is being tortured by the organization WCKD in hopes of developing a cure for the virus . Heading for the `` Last City '' , where WCKD 's headquarters is located , the group is attacked by Cranks , humans infected with the Flare . However , they are saved by Jorge and Brenda , who join them .   The group makes it to the wall of the Last City , which protects the city from Cranks . Outside the wall , people are rallying in protest to be let into the city . When WCKD opens fire at the protesters , the group is captured by a contingent of masked men and are taken to a hideout . One of the masked men is revealed to be Gally , who has survived being killed by Minho at the end of The Maze Runner . Gally takes them to see Lawrence , a rebellion leader for those outside the walls , who grants them permission to enter the Last City through a secret entrance . Gally leads Thomas and Newt through to the city and , spotting Teresa , Gally tells Thomas that she can get them into WCKD headquarters . The three capture her and she agrees to help them .   Thomas , Newt , and Gally escort Teresa inside WCKD headquarters and toward the location of the Immunes . Gally looks after the Immune children and stays to find a serum that can treat the Flare , while Thomas , Newt , and Teresa go to find Minho . They are caught and chased by a vengeful Janson , who leads WCKD 's troops . Teresa lets them escape to find Minho , before rushing to do a blood test on Thomas ' blood , which she obtained when removing trackers from the Gladers .   Gally gets the serum and takes the Immune children outside to a bus where Brenda is waiting . While Gally makes his way back into WCKD headquarters to find Thomas , Brenda is forced to leave with the Immune children in a bus as WCKD forces close in on them . Thomas and Newt reunite with Minho in the medical wing . They are chased by Janson before escaping . Teresa discovers that Thomas ' blood can cure the Flare . She shares her discovery with WCKD 's leader Ava Paige , both agreeing that they must find Thomas . Brenda and the Immune children are cornered by WCKD authorities but are saved by Frypan . Meanwhile , Lawrence rallies his rebels outside the city before blowing a hole in the city wall , allowing his allies and the infected people to storm the city . Outside the headquarters , Gally finds Thomas , Minho , and Newt . Sending Minho and Gally ahead , Newt gives Thomas a necklace with a silver cylinder pendant before passing out . Teresa transmits her voice throughout the city , telling Thomas that his blood can save Newt if he will only return to WCKD . Newt , nearly completely subsumed by the Flare , regains consciousness and attacks Thomas , while begging Thomas to kill him . Left with no other option , Thomas kills Newt .   Thomas makes his way back to WCKD and confronts Ava , who stresses that WCKD 's intentions are good . However , she is killed by Janson , who is turning into a Crank . Janson knocks Thomas out and drags him to a lab where Teresa is ready to extract his blood . However , he reveals that he and WCKD are only truly interested in curing those whom they please , which results in Teresa turning on him . After a fight , Janson is killed , allowing Thomas and Teresa to escape to the rooftop where an aircraft piloted by Jorge and Vince is waiting . Thomas makes it aboard , but Teresa is killed when the headquarters comes apart after being hit by a building collapsing owing to the rebels ' attacks .   The group reunites with the rest of the Immunes and The Right Arm , escaping to a safe haven that was revealed by Ava , where the remaining population can live in safety . There , Thomas discovers that the pendant Newt gave to him had a note in it . Still traumatized by Teresa 's death , he reads the note , in which Newt tells him to look after himself and everyone , before thanking Thomas for being his friend .

Nowlin , who co-wrote the first and wrote the second film , would adapt Maze Runner : The Death Cure . On September 16 , 2015 , it was confirmed that Ball would return to direct the final film .   Filming ( edit )   Principal photography began on March 14 , 2016 , in Vancouver , British Columbia . Previously it was revealed at San Diego Comic - Con International that filming would begin in February 2016 .   On March 18 , 2016 , it was reported that actor Dylan O'Brien was injured on set and was hospitalized . James Dashner announced via Twitter that the production was postponed after the accident . It was said that the producers were `` looking to '' resume filming around mid-May . According to the Directors Guild of Canada 's production list , the film was scheduled to resume filming on May 9 , and complete principal photography on July 26 . However , on April 29 , 2016 , production was shut down indefinitely as O'Brien's injuries were more serious than previously thought .   Filming resumed on March 6 , 2017 in Cape Town , South Africa . In May 2017 , it was announced that Walton Goggins would play the part of Lawrence , described as `` an unusual and dangerous character who is part - revolutionary , part - anarchist , and a voice for the voiceless people . '' Principal photography wrapped on June 3 , 2017 .   Release ( edit )   It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on February 17 , 2017 . However , due to Dylan O'Brien's injuries , the studio said that it was unlikely that this date was going to be met . On May 27 , 2016 , 20th Century Fox rescheduled the film for January 12 , 2018 , allowing time for Dylan O'Brien to fully recover .   On April 22 , 2017 , the studio delayed the release date once again , to February 9 , 2018 , in order to allow more time for post-production ; months later , on August 25 , the studio moved the release forward two weeks . The film premiered on January 26 , 2018 in theatres and IMAX .   Reception ( edit )   Box Office ( edit )   As of February 28 , 2018 , Maze Runner : The Death Cure has grossed $56.6 million in the United States and Canada , and $216.1 million in other territories , for a worldwide total of $272.6 million , against a production budget of $62 million .   In the United States and Canada , The Death Cure was released alongside the wide expansion of Hostiles , and was expected to gross around $20 million from 3,786 theaters in its opening weekend . The film made $1.5 million from Thursday night previews , in between the $1.1 million made by the first film and $1.7 million by the second , and $8.4 million on its first day . It ended up opening to $24.2 million , down from the previous film but still finishing atop the box office . In its second weekend the film dropped 58 % to $10.2 million , finishing second behind Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle .   A week prior to its North American release , the film debuted in South Korea , Australia and Taiwan , grossing $15.1 million over its opening weekend . During the first two weeks of international release , the film dominated the international box office taking $62.6 and $35.2 million respectively , and outpacing the two previous films .   Critical response ( edit )   On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 43 % based on 140 reviews , and an average rating of 5.1 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` Maze Runner : The Death Cure may offer closure to fans of the franchise , but for anyone who has n't already been hooked , this bloated final installment is best left unseen . '' On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100 , based on 37 critics , indicating `` mixed or average reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` B + '' on an A+ to F scale .   References ( edit )    Jump up ^ `` MAZE RUNNER : THE DEATH CURE ( 2018 ) ( 12A ) '' .

It forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate , and its motion is right - lateral strike - slip ( horizontal ) . The fault divides into three segments , each with different characteristics and a different degree of earthquake risk , the most significant being the southern segment , which passes within about 35 miles ( 56 km ) of Los Angeles . The slip rate along the fault ranges from 20 to 35 mm ( 0.79 to 1.38 in ) / yr .   The fault was first identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley , who discovered the northern zone . It is often described as having been named after San Andreas Lake , a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates . However , according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908 , Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley . Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California .   In 1953 , geologist Thomas Dibblee astounded the scientific establishment with his conclusion that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault . A project called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) near Parkfield , Monterey County , is drilling into the fault to improve prediction and recording of future earthquakes .

This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County . It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland , runs just east of the Bodega Heads through Bodega Bay and back underwater , returning onshore at Fort Ross . ( In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant `` sister faults '' run more - or-less parallel , and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes . ) From Fort Ross , the northern segment continues overland , forming in part a linear valley through which the Gualala River flows . It goes back offshore at Point Arena . After that , it runs underwater along the coast until it nears Cape Mendocino , where it begins to bend to the west , terminating at the Mendocino Triple Junction .   Central ( edit )   The central segment of the San Andreas Fault runs in a northwestern direction from Parkfield to Hollister . While the southern section of the fault and the parts through Parkfield experience earthquakes , the rest of the central section of the fault exhibits a phenomenon called aseismic creep , where the fault slips continuously without causing earthquakes .   Southern ( edit )  See also : Elsinore Fault Zone , Imperial Fault , Laguna Salada Fault , and San Jacinto Fault Zone  The southern segment ( also known as the Mojave segment ) begins near Bombay Beach , California . Box Canyon , near the Salton Sea , contains upturned strata associated with that section of the fault . The fault then runs along the southern base of the San Bernardino Mountains , crosses through the Cajon Pass and continues northwest along the northern base of the San Gabriel Mountains . These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range . In Palmdale , a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the Antelope Valley Freeway . The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of Elizabeth Lake . As it passes the towns of Gorman , Tejon Pass and Frazier Park , the fault begins to bend northward , forming the `` Big Bend '' . This restraining bend is thought to be where the fault locks up in Southern California , with an earthquake - recurrence interval of roughly 140 -- 160 years . Northwest of Frazier Park , the fault runs through the Carrizo Plain , a long , treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible . The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain .   The southern segment , which stretches from Parkfield in Monterey County all the way to the Salton Sea , is capable of an 8.1 - magnitude earthquake . At its closest , this fault passes about 35 miles ( 56 km ) to the northeast of Los Angeles . Such a large earthquake on this southern segment would kill thousands of people in Los Angeles , San Bernardino , Riverside , and surrounding areas , and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage .

( December 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The Pacific Plate , to the west of the fault , is moving in a northwest direction while the North American Plate to the east is moving toward the southwest , but relatively southeast under the influence of plate tectonics . The rate of slippage averages about 33 to 37 millimeters ( 1.3 to 1.5 in ) a year across California .   The southwestward motion of the North American Plate towards the Pacific is creating compressional forces along the eastern side of the fault . The effect is expressed as the Coast Ranges . The northwest movement of the Pacific Plate is also creating significant compressional forces which are especially pronounced where the North American Plate has forced the San Andreas to jog westward . This has led to the formation of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California , and to a lesser but still significant extent , the Santa Cruz Mountains ( the location of the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 ) .   Studies of the relative motions of the Pacific and North American plates have shown that only about 75 percent of the motion can be accounted for in the movements of the San Andreas and its various branch faults . The rest of the motion has been found in an area east of the Sierra Nevada mountains called the Walker Lane or Eastern California Shear Zone . The reason for this is not clear . Several hypotheses have been offered and research is ongoing . One hypothesis -- which gained interest following the Landers earthquake in 1992 -- suggests the plate boundary may be shifting eastward away from the San Andreas towards Walker Lane .   Assuming the plate boundary does not change as hypothesized , projected motion indicates that the landmass west of the San Andreas Fault , including Los Angeles , will eventually slide past San Francisco , then continue northwestward toward the Aleutian Trench , over a period of perhaps twenty million years .   Formation ( edit )  Tectonic evolution of the San Andreas Fault .  The San Andreas began to form in the mid Cenozoic about 30 Mya ( million years ago ) . At this time , a spreading center between the Pacific Plate and the Farallon Plate ( which is now mostly subducted , with remnants including the Juan de Fuca Plate , Rivera Plate , Cocos Plate , and the Nazca Plate ) was beginning to reach the subduction zone off the western coast of North America . As the relative motion between the Pacific and North American Plates was different from the relative motion between the Farallon and North American Plates , the spreading ridge began to be `` subducted '' , creating a new relative motion and a new style of deformation along the plate boundaries . These geological features are what are chiefly seen along San Andreas Fault . It also includes a possible driver for the deformation of the Basin and Range , separation of the Baja California Peninsula , and rotation of the Transverse Range .   The main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years . The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well - Fenner - San Francisquito fault zone around 22 -- 13 Ma . This system added the San Gabriel Fault as a primary focus of movement between 10 -- 5 Ma . Currently , it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the Eastern California Shear Zone . This complicated evolution , especially along the southern segment , is mostly caused by either the `` Big Bend '' and / or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and it surrounding branches .   Study ( edit )   Early years ( edit )   The fault was first identified in Northern California by UC Berkeley geology professor Andrew Lawson in 1895 and named by him after the Laguna de San Andreas , a small lake which lies in a linear valley formed by the fault just south of San Francisco . Eleven years later , Lawson discovered that the San Andreas Fault stretched southward into southern California after reviewing the effects of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . Large - scale ( hundreds of miles ) lateral movement along the fault was first proposed in a 1953 paper by geologists Mason Hill and Thomas Dibblee . This idea , which was considered radical at the time , has since been vindicated by modern plate tectonics .   Current research ( edit )   Seismologists discovered that the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield in central California consistently produces a magnitude 6.0 earthquake approximately once every 22 years . Following recorded seismic events in 1857 , 1881 , 1901 , 1922 , 1934 , and 1966 , scientists predicted that another earthquake should occur in Parkfield in 1993 . It eventually occurred in 2004 . Due to the frequency of predictable activity , Parkfield has become one of the most important areas in the world for large earthquake research .   In 2004 , work began just north of Parkfield on the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) . The goal of SAFOD is to drill a hole nearly 3 kilometres ( 1.9 mi ) into the Earth 's crust and into the San Andreas Fault . An array of sensors will be installed to record earthquakes that happen near this area .   The San Andreas Fault System has been the subject of a flood of studies . In particular , scientific research performed during the last 23 years has given rise to about 3,400 publications .   The next `` Big one '' ( edit )  Radar generated 3 - D view of the San Andreas Fault , at Crystal Springs Reservoir near San Mateo , California .  A study published in 2006 in the journal Nature found that the San Andreas fault has reached a sufficient stress level for an earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale to occur . This study also found that the risk of a large earthquake may be increasing more rapidly than scientists had previously believed . Moreover , the risk is currently concentrated on the southern section of the fault , i.e. the region around Los Angeles , because massive earthquakes have occurred relatively recently on the central ( 1857 ) and northern ( 1906 ) segments of the fault , while the southern section has not seen any similar rupture for at least 300 years . According to this study , a massive earthquake on that southern section of the San Andreas fault would result in major damage to the Palm Springs - Indio metropolitan area and other cities in San Bernardino , Riverside and Imperial counties in California , and Mexicali Municipality in Baja California . It would be strongly felt ( and potentially cause significant damage ) throughout much of Southern California , including densely populated areas of Los Angeles County , Ventura County , Orange County , San Diego County , Ensenada Municipality and Tijuana Municipality , Baja California , San Luis Rio Colorado in Sonora and Yuma , Arizona . Older buildings would be especially prone to damage or collapse , as would buildings built on unconsolidated gravel or in coastal areas where water tables are high ( and thus subject to soil liquefaction ) . The paper concluded :   The information available suggests that the fault is ready for the next big earthquake but exactly when the triggering will happen and when the earthquake will occur we can not tell ( ... ) It could be tomorrow or it could be 10 years or more from now .   Nevertheless , in the ten years since that publication there has not been a substantial quake in the Los Angeles area , and two major reports issued by the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) have made variable predictions as to the risk of future seismic events . The ability to predict major earthquakes with sufficient precision to warrant increased precautions has remained elusive .   The U.S. Geological Survey most recent forecast , known as UCERF3 ( Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3 ) , released in November 2013 , estimated that an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 M or greater ( i.e. equal to or greater than the 1994 Northridge earthquake ) occurs about once every 6.7 years statewide . The same report also estimated there is a 7 % probability that an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or greater will occur in the next 30 years somewhere along the San Andreas Fault . A different USGS study in 2008 tried to assess the physical , social and economic consequences of a major earthquake in southern California . That study predicted that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas Fault could cause about 1,800 deaths and $213 billion in damage .   Cascadia connection ( edit )   A 2008 paper , studying past earthquakes along the Pacific coastal zone , found a correlation in time between seismic events on the northern San Andreas Fault and the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone ( which stretches from Vancouver Island to northern California ) . Scientists believe quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas within the past 3,000 years . The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time - correlated events . However the 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been the exception to this correlation because the plate movement was moved mostly from south to north and it was not preceded by a major quake in the Cascadia zone .   Earthquakes ( edit )  See also : List of earthquakes in California  The San Andreas Fault has had some notable earthquakes in historic times :    1857 Fort Tejon earthquake : About 350 kilometers ( 220 mi ) were ruptured in central and southern California . Though it is known as the Fort Tejon earthquake , the epicenter is thought to have been located far to the north , just south of Parkfield . Two deaths were reported . The magnitude was about 7.9 .   1906 San Francisco earthquake : About 430 kilometers ( 270 mi ) were ruptured in Northern California . The epicenter was near San Francisco . At least 3,000 people died in the earthquake and subsequent fires . The magnitude was estimated to be 7.8 .   1957 San Francisco earthquake : A magnitude 5.7 quake with an epicenter on the San Andreas fault in the ocean west of San Francisco and Daly City .   1989 Loma Prieta earthquake : About 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) were ruptured ( although the rupture did not reach the surface ) near Santa Cruz , California , causing 63 deaths and moderate damage in certain vulnerable locations in the San Francisco Bay Area . Moment magnitude was about 6.9 . This quake occurred on October 17 , 1989 , at approximately 5 : 04 PM PDT .   2004 Parkfield earthquake : On September 28 , 2004 at 10 : 15 a.m. PDT , a magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck the Parkfield area . It was felt across the state , including the San Francisco Bay Area .

The game originated in Canada in the 1930s , where it is more popular than field lacrosse and is the national summer sport . Box lacrosse is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each , and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered . The playing area is called a box , in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse . The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick to catch , carry , and pass the ball in an effort to score by shooting a solid rubber lacrosse ball into the opponent 's goal .   The highest levels of box lacrosse are the National Lacrosse League ( NLL ) ( professional ) , Box Lacrosse League ( semi-pro ) , Senior A divisions of the Canadian Lacrosse Association ( semi-pro ) , the Western Lacrosse Association ( semi-pro ) , and Major Series Lacrosse ( semi-pro ) .   While there are 59 total members of the Federation of International Lacrosse ( FIL ) , only fifteen have competed in international box lacrosse competition . Only Canada , the Iroquois Nationals and the United States have finished in the top three places at the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships .

Lacrosse is a traditional indigenous people 's game and was first encountered by Europeans when French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley witnessed the game in the 1630s . Lacrosse for centuries was seen as a key element of cultural identity and spiritual healing to Native Americans . It originated as a field game and was adopted first by Canadian , American , and English athletes as a field game , eventually settling on a 10 v 10 format .   Box lacrosse is a modern version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s . The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure , but its invention has been attributed to one Paddy Brennan , a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal , who , being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game , experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s .   Joseph Cattarinich and Leo Dandurand , owners of the National Hockey League 's Montreal Canadiens in the 1920s , led the participating ice hockey arena owners to introduce the new sport . In the 1930s , 6 v 6 indoor lacrosse came to be played in the summer in unused hockey rinks . Canadians adopted the new version of the sport quickly . Eventually , it became the more popular version of the sport in Canada , supplanting field lacrosse . The form was also adopted as the primary version of the game played on Native American reservations in the US and Canada by Iroquois and other Native peoples . It is the only sport in which the American indigenous people are sanctioned to compete internationally , participating as the Iroquois Nationals . However , many field lacrosse enthusiasts viewed the new version of the sport with negativity .   The first professional box lacrosse games were held in 1931 . That summer , the arena owners formed the International Lacrosse League , featuring four teams : the Montreal Canadiens , Montreal Maroons , Toronto Maple Leafs , and Cornwall Colts . The league lasted only two seasons . In the wake of the original International Lacrosse League opened the American Box Lacrosse League featuring six teams : two in New York City , and one each in Brooklyn , Toronto , Boston , and Baltimore . The league played to small crowds on outdoor fields such as Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park , before closing midway through its inaugural season . Lacrosse was officially declared Canada 's National Summer Sport with the passage of the National Sports Act ( Bill C - 212 ) on May 12 , 1994 .   The first box lacrosse match conducted in Australia came about as part of a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne . The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a lacrosse match as part of a multi sport carnival at the Plaza ( Wattle Path Palais ) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931 . After a lightning six - a-side ( outdoor ) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior , it was decided to play six - a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs , with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match . Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even been created in Australia , with P.J. Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of the rules of the game from the VLA Secretary . By 1933 , box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide , Brisbane , and Perth . This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada .   The Canadian Lacrosse Association began sponsoring box lacrosse . In 1932 , the Mann Cup , the most prestigious lacrosse trophy in Canada , was contended for under box lacrosse rules for the first time . Previously , the national senior men 's lacrosse championship , awarded since 1901 , was competed for under field lacrosse rules . The Mann Cup is an annual tournament that presents the champion of the Western Lacrosse Association and Major Series Lacrosse in a best of seven national championship . A few years later , in 1937 , the Minto Cup , began being awarded under box lacrosse rules to the junior men 's champions . Currently the Canadian Lacrosse Association oversees the Mann Cup , the Minto Cup , the Presidents Cup ( Senior B national championship ) the Founders Cup ( Junior B national championship ) all under box lacrosse rules .   Briefly in 1939 , a professional box lacrosse league started up in California , called the Pacific Coast Lacrosse Association . This four team league also folded shortly after opening . Professional box lacrosse did not return to the United States again until 1968 when the Portland Adanacs and Detroit Olympics franchises played in the National Lacrosse Association , a circuit that folded after one summer season seaso .  National Lacrosse League action during an All - Star Game in 2005  A new professional indoor lacrosse league was created in the 1970s with the formation of the original National Lacrosse League . This league opened in 1974 with teams in Montreal , Toronto , Rochester , Syracuse , Philadelphia , and Maryland . For the 1975 season , Rochester moved to Boston , Syracuse moved to Quebec City , and Toronto moved to Long Island . Thus , by its second year , the original NLL was playing in all major league arenas : the Colisée de Québec , the Montreal Forum , the Boston Garden , Nassau Coliseum , the Spectrum , and the Capital Centre . When the two wealthier ' 75 NLL franchises , Philadelphia and Maryland , finished out of the playoffs , and with Montreal losing access to the fabled Montreal Forum in the upcoming season due to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games , the league folded after two seasons due to financial uncertainty .   The rebirth of professional box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13 , 1986 , with the formation of the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League , which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz . The league originated with four teams : the Philadelphia Wings , New Jersey Saints , Washington Wave , and Baltimore Thunder , and unlike box lacrosse generally , was played during the winter . The league rebranded itself as the Major Indoor Lacrosse League ( MILL ) immediately after its inaugural season , and in 1998 renamed itself again , this time to the NLL . In 1998 , the NLL entered into the Canadian market for the first time with the Ontario Raiders . Although 5 of the league 's 9 teams are based in American cities , more than two - thirds of the players are Canadian .   Rules ( edit )   Players , equipment and officials ( edit )  Windsor Clippers ( OJBLL ) runner in 2014 .  During play , a team consists of six players : a goaltender and five `` runners '' . A runner is any non-goalkeeper position player , including forwards , transition players , and defenders . Runners usually specialize in one of these roles and substitute off the field when the ball moves from one end to the other . When the sport originated teams played with six runners . However , in 1953 the sixth runner , a position called rover , was eliminated . The goalkeeper can be replaced by another runner , often when a delayed penalty has been called on the other team or at the end of games by teams that are behind to help score goals .   A player 's lacrosse stick must be between 40 inches ( 1.0 m ) and 46 inches ( 1.2 m ) in length ( youth levels may use shorter sticks ) . In most box lacrosse leagues , the use of a traditional wooden stick is allowed . However , almost no lacrosse players use wooden sticks anymore , preferring aluminum or another metal , and a plastic head . In the NLL , wooden lacrosse sticks are not allowed . Besides a lacrosse stick , each player must also wear a certain amount of protective equipment , including a lacrosse helmet with facemask , lacrosse gloves , arm and shoulder pads , and back / kidney pads . Rib pads are optional in some leagues .   In some box leagues , especially the NLL , the five `` runners '' wear helmets specifically designed for box lacrosse . These helmets consist of a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse face mask attached instead of a hockey cage .   During a typical game the number of officials can range from one to three , depending on the league and level of play . In most games there are at least two referees : a lead official and a trail official . In NLL games there are three officials per game .  Goaltender ( edit ) See also : Goaltender ( box lacrosse ) St. Catharines Spartans ( OJBLL ) goalie in 2014 .  The goaltender 's responsibility is to prevent the opposition from scoring goals by directly defending the net . Box lacrosse goaltenders equipment includes upper body gear ( measuring no more than 3 inches ( 7.6 cm ) up and 5 inches ( 13 cm ) out off the shoulder -- much larger than similar gear for field lacrosse or ice hockey goaltenders ) , large shin guards that must measure no more than 11 inches ( 28 cm ) at the knee , 9 inches ( 23 cm ) at the top of the shin and 7 inches ( 18 cm ) at the ankle , and a field lacrosse helmet or ice hockey goalie mask .   The 9 feet ( 2.7 m ) to 9 feet 3 inches ( 2.82 m ) radius area surrounding the net is called the `` crease '' . Players except for the goaltender may not enter the crease while playing the ball . Punishments for crease infractions include a change of possession , resetting of the time - clock , or a possible two - minute penalty depending on the infraction . Opposing players may not make contact with the goaltender while he is in the crease . Once he leaves the crease , however , he loses all goaltender privileges .   Even as box lacrosse grows in the United States , the American goalkeeper is a rarity . The skills required to be a successful field lacrosse goaltender and a successful box lacrosse goaltender are very different and do not lend well to one another .  Defenders ( edit )  A defender is a player position whose primary responsibility is to prevent the opposing team from scoring . Unlike in field lacrosse where some defensive players carry longer sticks , all box lacrosse defenders play with a maximum 46 inches ( 1.2 m ) long stick . Defensive tactics include cross checking ( where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance ) , body checking ( where a player makes contact with the opposition player in order to slow him down ) , and stick checking ( where a player makes contact with the opposition player 's stick in order to knock the ball loose ) .  Transition ( edit )  A transition player is a player whose responsibility is primarily to play during defensive situations with an offensive mindset . The goal of this player is to create fastbreaks and scoring opportunities .  Forwards ( edit )  A forward is a player position on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive . Typically , a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other , and will primarily play on that side of the floor . Some players , known as creasemen , do not focus on one side or the other . These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender .   Playing area ( edit )  Detailed diagram illustrating the differences and similarities between Canadian Lacrosse Association and National Lacrosse League box lacrosse playing areas  The playing area of box lacrosse is typically an ice hockey rink during the summer months . The playing surface is usually the concrete floor underneath the melted ice . Generally the playing area is 180 feet ( 55 m ) to 200 feet ( 61 m ) in length and 80 feet ( 24 m ) to 90 feet ( 27 m ) in width . The NLL plays on artificial turf placed on top of the ice . Some leagues , and teams that have dedicated box lacrosse arenas ( such as the Iroquois ) , have outfitted their playing surface with artificial turf similar to the NLL .   Box lacrosse goal dimensions are traditionally 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) tall . In the NLL , the dimensions are slightly larger at 4 feet 9 inches ( 1.45 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) tall . These nets are significantly smaller than field lacrosse nets which measure 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) wide by 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) tall .   Duration and tie - breaking methods ( edit )   A traditional game played under the rules of the Canadian Lacrosse Association consists of three periods of 20 minutes each ( similar to ice hockey ) , with the teams changing ends each period . The NLL plays four 15 - minute quarters rather than three periods . If the game is tied at the end of regulation play , a 5 - minute overtime ( 15 in NLL ) can be played . Overtime may or may not be sudden victory , depending on the league .   Ball in and out of play ( edit )  Referee placing the ball while opponents line up for a face - off .  Each period , and after each goal scored , play is restarted with a face - off . If a ball travels over the boards and outside of the playing area , play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball .   During play , teams may substitute players in and out freely . Sometimes this is referred to as `` on the fly '' substitution . Substitution must occur within the designated exchange area in front of the players bench in order to be legal . The sport utilizes a shot clock and the attacking team must take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball . In addition , players must advance the ball from their own defensive end to the offensive half of the floor within 10 seconds ( 8 in NLL ) .   Penalties ( edit )   For most penalties , the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one less player for a short amount of time . Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed . The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the other team is on the power play .   A two - minute minor penalty is often called for lesser infractions such as slashing , tripping , elbowing , roughing , too many players , illegal equipment , holding , or interference . Five - minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent , as well as for fighting . Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires , or the opposition scores a goal ( or three goals for the instance of a major penalty ) .   At the officials ' discretion a ten - minute misconduct penalty may be assessed . These are served in full by the penalized player , but his team may immediately substitute another player on the playing area unless a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct ( a `` two - and - ten '' or `` five - and - ten '' ) . In that case , the team designates another player to serve the minor or major ; both players go to the penalty box , but only the designee may not be replaced , and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes . In addition , game misconducts are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent . A player who receives a game misconduct is ejected and may not return to play . Receiving two major penalties in a game will result in a game misconduct .  A fight during a lacrosse game between two players on the Toronto Rock and Calgary Roughnecks  A penalty shot , where a player from the non-offending team is given an attempt to score a goal without opposition from any defending players except the goaltender , may be awarded under certain circumstances . By rule , teams must have at least three runners in play . If a team commits a third penalty resulting in a `` three man down '' situation a penalty shot is awarded in favor of having the offending player serve in the penalty box . A penalty shot may also be awarded , at the referee 's discretion , if a defensive player causes a foul to prevent a goal ( by throwing his stick , holding , tripping , or by deliberately displacing the goal , or a defensive player intentionally falls and covers a ball in his own team 's crease ) . In the NLL , a penalty shot is awarded against any team taking a too - many - men penalty in the final two minutes of the game or overtime .  Fighting ( edit )  Similar to fighting in ice hockey , fighting is tolerated in professional box lacrosse . Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection , but incur a five - minute major penalty . In Canadian Lacrosse Association play , players are assessed a five - minute major penalty plus a game misconduct . Fighting in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions . In 1990 , when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league , fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable . Violators were ejected from the game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension .   International competition ( edit )   Box lacrosse is the most popular version of the sport in the Czech Republic . It is also played to a marginal degree in Australia , primarily by players who have played field lacrosse . Club level box lacrosse leagues in the United States have increased the number of players exposed to the sport , including the : Baltimore Indoor Lacrosse League , the Philadelphia Box Lacrosse Association , and the Metro Area Box Lacrosse League .   The first world championship of box lacrosse , `` The Nations in 1980 '' , was staged in several arenas in British Columbia , Canada in July 1980 involving teams representing the United States , Australia , Canada East , Canada West and the Iroquois Nationals . Canada West ( Coquitlam Adanacs ) defeated the Iroquois in the nationally televised world championship game from Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver . This was the first time in history that Indigenous peoples of the Americas people represented themselves in an athletic world championship competition .   The second international box lacrosse tournament was held in 2003 , with the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championships . The competitors were national teams from Australia , Canada , the Czech Republic , the Iroquois Nationals , Scotland , and the United States .   The 2015 WILC was hosted by the Onondaga Nation which marks the first time an international sporting event has been held on indigenous land . 13 teams competed in the championship : Australia , Canada , Czech Republic , England , Finland , Germany , Iroquois Nationals , Ireland , Israel , Serbia , Switzerland , Turkey , and the United States .   Canada , Iroquois Nationals and the United States have won gold , silver , and bronze respectively in each of the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships held . Canada has yet to lose an international game in box lacrosse .   Other international tournaments have been played . Annually , the European Lacrosse Federation holds the Aleš Hřebeský Memorial tournament in Prague . This is the largest European box lacrosse tournament . In 2002 and 2004 , the Heritage Cup was played between the United States and Canada featuring mostly players that were members of NLL teams .   Women ( edit )   Historically , box lacrosse has been exclusively a men 's sport . Women who played the sport of lacrosse typically played the women 's field lacrosse version . Recently , Ontario , Alberta , Nova Scotia and British Columbia have established girls ' and women 's box lacrosse leagues .   During the 2003 NLL season , goaltender Ginny Capicchioni appeared in two preseason and one regular season games to become the only woman to make an appearance in the NLL .

It 's a rougher adaptation of the original field versions of lacrosse with elements similar to hockey and basketball . It has the speed , agility , flexibilty , coordination and main aspect of scoring on a net from hockey , the offensive set up ( 2 - 2 - 1 ) `` house '' when attacking the other team 's goal , a shot clock of 30 seconds to shoot on the net , and regular setting of `` picks '' similar to basketball . Box lacrosse defenders are allowed to block attackers from getting near their goal by cross checking , a technique that is not allowed in field lacrosse .

       "  'document_text_clean': \"Three seconds rule - Wikipedia  Three seconds rule  Jump to : navigation , search Not to be confused with the Five - second rule of food hygiene , or the two - second rule regarding safe driving , both sometimes known as the three - second rule .  The three seconds rule ( also referred to as the three - second rule or three in the key , with often termed a lane violation ) requires that in basketball , a player shall not remain in the opponents ' restricted area for more than three consecutive seconds while their team is in control of a live ball in the frontcourt and the game clock is running .   The three - second rule was introduced in 1936 and was expressed as such : no offensive player with the ball could remain in the Key with or without the ball , for more than three seconds .   The three - second rule came about in part following a game at Madison Square Garden between the University of Kentucky ( UK ) and New York University ( NYU ) in 1935 , won by NYU 23 - 22 . The university of Kentucky team did not take their own referee , a common practice at the time , despite advice to the UK coach Adolph Rupp from Notre Dame coach George Keogan , who had lost to NYU the week prior and who warned Rupp of the discrepancies in officiating between the Midwest and the East . The game was rough . UK was unable to run its normal offense ( which consisted of using screens ) without being called for a foul . New York University 's Irving Terjesen and Irwin Klein combined to guard one of UK 's major players , Leroy Edwards , allowing him to score a mere 6 points ( the lowest output of his career ) . The New York Post reacted with alarm : `` The score says that NYU is the best college basketball team in the country and that the East still is supreme . But if Frank Lane , the referee from the Midwest , had worked the game , it 's safe to assume big Leroy Edwards would have been given a fantastic number of foul shots . Minor mayhem was committed on the person of Edwards by Terjesen and Klein . Something will have to be done or the game will become entirely too rough .

Their use has been extended to many other meanings , more or less analogous . Plus and minus are Latin terms meaning `` more '' and `` less '' , respectively .     Contents  ( hide )   1 History   2 Plus sign   3 Minus sign   4 Use in elementary education   5 Use as a qualifier   6 Uses in computing   7 Other uses   8 Character codes   8.1 Alternative plus sign     9 See also   10 References and footnotes      History ( edit )   Though the signs now seem as familiar as the alphabet or the Hindu - Arabic numerals , they are not of great antiquity . The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for addition , for example , resembled a pair of legs walking in the direction in which the text was written ( Egyptian could be written either from right to left or left to right ) , with the reverse sign indicating subtraction :                 or                 Nicole Oresme 's manuscripts from the 14th century show what may be one of the earliest uses of the plus sign `` + '' .   In Europe in the early 15th century the letters `` P '' and `` M '' were generally used . The symbols ( P with line p̄ for più , i.e. , plus , and M with line m̄ for meno , i.e. , minus ) appeared for the first time in Luca Pacioli 's mathematics compendium , Summa de arithmetica , geometria , proportioni et proportionalità , first printed and published in Venice in 1494 . The + is a simplification of the Latin `` et '' ( comparable to the ampersand & ) . The − may be derived from a tilde written over m when used to indicate subtraction ; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter m itself . In his 1489 treatise Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols − and + as minus and mer ( Modern German mehr ; `` more '' ) : `` was − ist , das ist minus , und das + ist das mer '' . They were n't used for addition and subtraction here , but to indicate surplus and deficit ; their first use in their modern sense appears in a book by Henricus Grammateus in 1518 .   Robert Recorde , the designer of the equals sign , introduced plus and minus to Britain in 1557 in The Whetstone of Witte : `` There be other 2 signes in often use of which the first is made thus + and betokeneth more : the other is thus made -- and betokeneth lesse . ''   Plus sign ( edit )  `` + '' redirects here . For other uses , see + ( disambiguation ) .  The plus sign ( + ) is a binary operator that indicates addition , as in 2 + 3 = 5 . It can also serve as a unary operator that leaves its operand unchanged ( + x means the same as x ) . This notation may be used when it is desired to emphasize the positiveness of a number , especially when contrasting with the negative ( + 5 versus − 5 ) .   The plus sign can also indicate many other operations , depending on the mathematical system under consideration . Many algebraic structures have some operation which is called , or is equivalent to , addition . It is conventional to use the plus sign to only denote commutative operations . Moreover , the symbolism has been extended to very different operations ; plus can also mean :    exclusive or ( usually written ⊕ ) : 1 + 1 = 0 , 1 + 0 = 1   logical disjunction ( usually written ∨ ) : 1 + 1 = 1 , 1 + 0 = 1    Minus sign ( edit )  `` − '' redirects here . It is not to be confused with Hyphen , Hyphen - minus , or Dash .  The minus sign ( − ) has three main uses in mathematics :    The subtraction operator : A binary operator to indicate the operation of subtraction , as in 5 − 3 = 2 . Subtraction is the inverse of addition .   Directly in front of a number ( numeric literal ) and when it is not a subtraction operator it means a negative number . For instance − 5 is negative 5 .   A unary operator that acts as an instruction to replace the operand by its additive inverse . For example , if x is 3 , then − x is − 3 , but if x is − 3 , then − x is 3 . Similarly , − ( − 2 ) is equal to 2 . The above is a special case of this .    All three uses can be referred to as `` minus '' in everyday speech . In most English - speaking countries , − 5 ( for example ) is normally pronounced `` minus five '' , but in modern US usage it is instead usually pronounced `` negative five '' ; here , `` minus '' may be used by speakers born before 1950 , and is still popular in some contexts , but `` negative '' is usually taught as the only correct reading . Further , some few textbooks in the United States encourage − x to be read as `` the opposite of x '' or `` the additive inverse of x '' to avoid giving the impression that − x is necessarily negative .   In some contexts , different glyphs are used for these meanings ; for instance in the computer language APL and the expression language used by Texas Instruments graphing calculators ( definitely at least the early models including the TI - 81 and TI - 82 ) a raised minus sign is used in negative numbers ( as in 2 − 5 shows 3 ) , but such usage is uncommon .   In mathematics and most programming languages , the rules for the order of operations mean that − 5 is equal to − 25 : Powers bind more strongly than the unary minus , which binds more strongly than multiplication or division . However , in some programming languages and Microsoft Excel in particular , unary operators bind strongest , so in those cases − 5 ^ 2 is 25 but 0 − 5 ^ 2 is − 25 .   Use in elementary education ( edit )   Some elementary teachers use raised plus and minus signs before numbers to show they are positive or negative numbers . For example , subtracting − 5 from 3 might be read as `` positive three take away negative 5 '' and be shown as    3 − 5 becomes 3 + 5 = 8 ,    or even as    3 − 5 becomes 3 + 5 = 8 .    Use as a qualifier ( edit )   In grading systems ( such as examination marks ) , the plus sign indicates a grade one level higher and the minus sign a grade lower . For example , B − ( `` B minus '' ) is one grade lower than B. Sometimes this is extended to two plus or minus signs ; for example A++ is two grades higher than A .   Positive and negative are sometimes abbreviated as + ve and − ve .   In mathematics the one - sided limit x → a means x approaches a from the right , and x → a means x approaches a from the left . For example , when calculating what x is when x approaches 0 , because x → + ∞ when x → 0 but x → − ∞ when x → 0 .   Blood types are often qualified with a plus or minus to indicate the presence or absence of the Rh factor ; for instance , A+ means A-type blood with the Rh factor present , while B − means B - type blood with the Rh factor absent .   In music , augmented chords are symbolized with a plus sign , although this practice is not universal as there are other methods for spelling those chords . For example , `` C + '' is read `` C augmented chord '' . Also used as superscript .   Uses in computing ( edit )   As well as the normal mathematical usage plus and minus may be used for a number of other purposes in computing .   Plus and minus signs are often used in tree view on a computer screen to show if a folder is collapsed or not .   In some programming languages , concatenation of strings is written `` a '' + `` b '' , and results in `` ab '' .   In most programming languages , subtraction and negation are indicated with the ASCII hyphen - minus character , - . In APL a raised minus sign ( Unicode U + 00AF ) is used to denote a negative number , as in _̄ 3 . While in J a negative number is denoted by an underscore , as in _5 .   In C and some other computer programming languages , two plus signs indicate the increment operator and two minus signs a decrement . For example , x++ means `` increment the value of x by one '' and x -- means `` decrement the value of x by one '' . By extension , `` + + '' is sometimes used in computing terminology to signify an improvement , as in the name of the language C++ .   In regular expressions , `` + '' is used to indicate `` 1 or more '' in a pattern to be matched . For example , `` x + '' means `` one or more of the letter x '' .   There is no concept of negative zero in mathematics , but in computing − 0 may have a separate representation from zero . In the IEEE floating - point standard , 1 / − 0 is negative infinity ( − ∞ ) whereas 1 / 0 is positive infinity ( ∞ ) .   Other uses ( edit )   In chemistry , the minus sign ( rather than an en dash ) is used for a single covalent bond between two atoms , as in the skeletal formula .   Subscripted plus and minus signs are used as diacritics in the International Phonetic Alphabet to indicate advanced or retracted articulations of speech sounds .   The minus sign is also used as tone letter in the orthographies of Dan , Krumen , Karaboro , Mwan , Wan , Yaouré , Wè , Nyabwa and Godié . The Unicode character used for the tone letter ( U + 02D7 ) is different from the mathematical minus sign .   In the algebraic notation used to record games of chess , the plus sign ( + ) is used to denote a move that puts the opponent into check . A double plus ( + + ) is sometimes used to denote double check . Combinations of the plus and minus signs are used to evaluate a move ( + / − , + / = , = / + , − / + ) .   Character codes ( edit )  Plus , minus , and hyphen - minus .

It is usually shorter in length than the plus sign and sometimes at a different height . It can be used as a substitute for the true minus sign when the character set is limited to ASCII . Most programming languages and other computer readable languages do this , since ASCII is generally available as a subset of most character encodings , while U + 2212 is a Unicode feature only .   There is a commercial minus sign ( ⁒ ) , which looks somewhat like an obelus , at U + 2052 ( HTML & # x2052 ;) .   The &plus ; entity is HTML 5 .  For detailed distinctions between minus signs and dashes , see Dash § Similar Unicode characters .  Alternative plus sign ( edit )  See also : Up tack  A Jewish tradition that dates from at least the 19th century is to write plus using a symbol like an inverted T . This practice was adopted into Israeli schools and is still commonplace today in elementary schools ( including secular schools ) but in fewer secondary schools . It is also used occasionally in books by religious authors , but most books for adults use the international symbol `` + '' . The reason for this practice is that it avoids the writing of a symbol `` + '' that looks like a Christian cross . Unicode has this symbol at position U + FB29 + HEBREW LETTER ALTERNATIVE PLUS SIGN .

And Bob 's your uncle is an expression of unknown origin , that means `` and there it is '' or `` and there you have it . '' It is commonly used in Great Britain and Commonwealth countries . Typically , someone says it to conclude a set of simple instructions or when a result is reached . The meaning is similar to that of the French expression `` et voilà ! ''   `` Bob 's your uncle '' is an exclamation that is used when `` everything is all right '' and the simple means of obtaining the successful result is explained . For example : `` left over right ; right over left , and Bob 's your uncle -- a reef knot . '' Sometimes the phrase is followed with `` and Nellie 's your aunt '' or `` and Fanny 's your aunt . '' It is sometimes elaborately phrased Robert is your mother 's brother or similar for comic effect .   Origin ( edit )   A.J. Langguth and others have suggested that the expression arose after Conservative Prime Minister Robert `` Bob '' Cecil appointed his nephew Arthur Balfour as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1887 , an act which was apparently both surprising and unpopular . Whatever other qualifications Balfour might have had , `` Bob 's your uncle '' was seen as the conclusive one . Regardless of the origin , the meaning has become acknowledging , announcing , or explaining a result or outcome that is achieved more easily than might be imagined .   It is suggested in Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts that Frederick Roberts , 1st Earl Roberts was known as Uncle Bobs and that the phrase referred to him .

It first aired on May 18 , 2000 , as the finale to the sixth season . It is normally transmitted as a whole episode in a one - hour slot , but when it is split for a half - hour slot the episodes are differentiated by having the title suffixed with Part One and Part Two . The episode was selected for Volume 4 of the `` Best of Friends '' DVD series , and when the series left the air in 2004 , several articles and viewer polls included this episode as one of the 10 best of the series ' 236 episodes .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Plot   1.1 Part One   1.2 Part Two     2 Production   3 Reception   3.1 Awards and nominations     4 References   5 External links      Plot ( edit )   Part one ( edit )   Ross is being questioned by his friends about his relationship with Elizabeth ( Alexandra Holden ) ; mainly asking if the relationship is going anywhere . Ross quickly claims he and Elizabeth are great together , and his friends are all wrong ... until he sees her having a water balloon fight with her buddies . Deciding she is too young , he breaks off the relationship . Afterward , Ross questions his decision , until Elizabeth confirms her immaturity by dropping water balloons on his head from her upstairs window .   Rachel takes Phoebe and Joey to a charity event helping children , including a silent auction . While Phoebe is obviously over-drinking ( Phoebe : `` The more I drink , the less there is for the kids to drink ! '' ) , Joey has bigger problems ; misunderstanding the silent auction process , Joey thought that bidders guessed an item 's worth , with the prize going to the person with the closest guess . ( Rachel : Why would a charity give away a free boat ? Joey : I do n't know ... charity ? ) Joey `` guesses '' $20,000 and `` wins '' a yacht . Rachel and Joey try to convince the next highest bidder to buy the boat , but in the process of persuading the man of the boat 's virtues , Joey changes his mind and wants it for himself , although he can barely afford it .   After weeks of preparation , Chandler is ready to propose to Monica . While at a restaurant , Chandler begins his proposal however before he can ask the question Monica 's ex-boyfriend Richard ( Tom Selleck ) walks in and the moment is lost . When the others come home from the charity event , they constantly ask to see Monica 's hand , thinking Chandler proposed already . Feeling that Monica will figure out that Chandler plans to propose ( Chandler : `` Who walks into a room and asks to see a person 's hands ? ! '' ) , Joey suggests that Chandler pretend he does n't care about marriage and never wants to get married . Meanwhile , Richard approaches Monica at work and declares his love for her .   Part two ( edit )   The episode began with Richard telling Monica that he 's never gotten over her and that he wants to marry and have children with her . Monica is left confused and when Chandler talks about how he hates marriage and ca n't see why anyone should get married she starts to feel unsure about their whole relationship . After Joey confirms to Monica that Chandler seemingly has no interest in getting married , Monica decides enough is enough and goes to meet Richard - she describes his apartment as `` a grown - up 's apartment '' and talks to him about the unfairness of the situation . Joey meanwhile tells Chandler how his plan has backfired on him and he is now in serious danger of losing Monica for good , and he leaves on a frantic search intending to propose when he finds her . After Monica leaves Richard 's apartment , Chandler comes and asks for Monica - he starts off by saying that Richard is a very bad man and he had his chances but he blew them . He also says that he and Monica are meant to be together and now Richard has blown Chandler 's chances , revealing he 'd intended to propose . Richard advises Chandler to go to Monica , warning that if he succeeds in winning her back , he must never let her go .   After searching all day , Chandler hurries back to his apartment and when he gets there , Joey meets him in the hall , claiming Monica has left him because of his commitment issues . When Chandler enters their apartment , afraid of Monica actually leaving , he discovers that it 's far from being abandoned , there are candles lit all over and Monica is kneeling to propose . In the midst of proposing to Chandler , she cries from sheer emotion , saying , `` There 's a reason why girls do n't do this ! '' Instead , Chandler gets on his knees and proposes to her and Monica says yes . They then open the door to Joey , Rachel , and Phoebe , who have been waiting to celebrate . At first , they hesitate , feeling Ross should be there to share the moment , then decide that after three marriages , Ross can afford to miss one engagement celebration . End credits play while Monica and Chandler dance to Eric Clapton 's `` Wonderful Tonight . ''   Production ( edit )   According to the producers ' DVD commentary for this episode , the original plot for Ross was to have Elizabeth announce that she was pregnant , ultimately resolving at the end of the following season when it would be revealed that Ross was not the father of the baby . This idea was ultimately rejected by the producers since it would be investing a lot of time in a secondary character without a payoff . It would have also have been difficult to use the cliffhanger for Rachel 's pregnancy .   Sources suggest that David Schwimmer was actually out of the country filming Band of Brothers when the final scenes of the episode were filmed , hence why Ross is not there when the friends hug Monica and Chandler on hearing their announcement .   The producers decided to end the episode on a romantic moment rather than the usual joke . They also took care over the script before approaching Selleck to return as Richard , as the actor would only return if it seemed feasible .   The episode very nearly served as the series finale , given that NBC and Warner Bros. were in negotiations over the show 's future up until four days before the episode aired . The series ' stars demanded $750,000 salary for each actor per episode and agreed to a contract for two additional seasons , an agreement that later stretched into a further two seasons at $1 million salary for each of the stars .   Reception ( edit )   Entertainment Weekly listed Chandler and Monica 's proposal scene in their `` 26 Great ' I Love You 's '' .

Air Date   Audition Venue   City   Audition Date     May 30 , 2016   Orpheum Theatre   Los Angeles , CA   February 27 , 2016     June 6 , 2016   Lou Conte Dance Studio   Chicago , IL   March 11 , 2016     June 13 , 2016   Broadway Dance Center   New York City   March 18 , 2016     During the audition round , the judges interviewed each auditioner , watched a brief audition and gave feedback , while the auditioner 's family sat at the side of the stage and often participated in the interviews . Offstage , Cat Deeley chatted with contestants and judges . Approximately 100 dancers were sent through to the Academy .   Dance Academy ( edit )   Dance Academy week was split among two episodes . The June 20 episode covered the first day of the Academy . The first task for the 10 all - stars was to watch solo dances by each of the competitors who were sent through from the auditions . From these , each all - star selected five dancers ( at least three from their own dance style ) , from the large number of auditioners , to join their `` team '' . If a dancer was selected by more than one all - star , he or she could choose which all - star 's team to join . Choreographer Warren Carlyle and the all - stars then taught the 50 remaining competitors a Broadway couples dance routine in 90 minutes , and dancers from each team were paired with dancers from another team . After all of the couples danced , each all - star was required to cut one dancer from his or her team , leaving a total of 40 contestants . Throughout the episode , Maddie Ziegler and Cat Deeley interviewed successful competitors .   The June 27 episode covered days two and three of Academy week . On day two , the all - stars each narrowed down their teams to three and then two dancers , based first on a hip - hop routine for pairs choreographed by Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo , and then on a contemporary routine , created by Travis Wall , danced simultaneously by the remaining three members of each team . On the last day , the last two dancers from each team danced a solo just for their own all - star . Each all - star then selected one finalist , making a total of 10 finalists that he or she will mentor through the finals round . The all - stars and their finalists are :       Contemporary     Kathryn McCormick : season 6 , 3rd place -- Tate   Robert Roldan : season 7 , 3rd place -- J.T.

The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti .   The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans .   An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Casting   2 Character history   2.1 Name     3 Death   4 Notes   5 References      Casting ( edit )   During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call .   They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer .   Character history ( edit )   The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 .   The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love .   In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college .   On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby , as seen in the season 4 finale `` The Leap '' , he is seen in front of the classroom of students , one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother . But in the first episode of season 5 , `` Definitions '' , it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom -- Economics instead of Architecture . At the same time in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy ( Rachel Bilson ) , whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate . They see Ted enter the room , but when he announces the subject , The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off . She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom .   Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time .   Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band .   In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar .   In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding .   The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after .   The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey .   In `` Bass Player Wanted '' , the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall , carrying his son Marvin , on her way to Farhampton Inn . On their way , it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band , that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception . But the band 's leader , Darren , forced her to quit . The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band . She ends up alone at the bar , and while practicing a speech to give Darren , Darren walks up to her furious the groom 's best man punched him for `` no reason . '' Amused by this , the Mother laughs , and Darren quits the band in anger .   In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door .   In `` Gary Blauman '' , Ted and the Mother are on their first date . Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish - Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner . On the way there , Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run - in with Louis . She says that she is in the `` weirdest place on earth '' right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating . Ted walks her back to her apartment . They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away . The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her . When the story is over , they say goodnight again . The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time , before deciding to carry on their date .   In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton .   Name ( edit )   The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy .   Death ( edit )  See also : Last Forever  In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' .   A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 .   Notes ( edit )    Jump up ^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that `` Pilot '' is set . The pilot is set on September 19 , 2005 .
