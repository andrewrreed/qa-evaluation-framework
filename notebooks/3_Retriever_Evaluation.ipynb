       " 'document_text_clean': \"List of Premier League broadcasters - wikipedia  List of Premier League broadcasters  Jump to : navigation , search  This is a list of television broadcasters which provide coverage of the Premier League , English football 's top level competition , which is the most watched league in the world . The main broadcasters in the United Kingdom are Sky Sports , who broadcast 126 of the 168 televised games in the UK , and BT Sport . The BBC shows weekly highlights of the Premier League on its Match of the Day and Match of the Day 2 programmes on Saturdays and Sundays .   The 168 UK televised games are also broadcast across the world ; the remaining 212 matches that are n't broadcast live in the UK are all broadcast elsewhere around the world . English - speaking countries ( excluding the UK ) are able to carry what is known as the ' International feed ' or ' World feed ' audio ; this is full match commentary provided by the Premier League . In Asia , and select other countries around the world , there is also a fully produced studio broadcast where pre , half time and post-match analysis is offered . This is currently hosted by John Dykes .   The 3 : 00pm ( UK time ) Saturday kick - offs are not allowed to be shown live in the UK due to the hours of 2.45 pm - 5.15 pm being ' blocked broadcasting hours ' , as requested by the FA and enforced by UEFA . In Ireland , a different situation applies ; a package of only one Saturday 3 : 00pm kick off each week ( along with one game on the final Sunday ) is sold as an addition to the UK live rights packages , this package is currently held by Sky Sports . While there is no rule prohibiting the screening of the other 3 : 00pm games in Ireland , the Premier League does not make the rights to these games available to Irish broadcasters , due to the overlap in reception that is possible in Northern Ireland and mainland England and not 's total match completely absolute live in total all interviews season the paradox that total matches live other will only be seen on streaming sites of he Premier League TV .
