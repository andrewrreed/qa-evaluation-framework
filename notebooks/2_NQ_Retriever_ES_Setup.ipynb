The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti .   The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans .   An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Casting   2 Character history   2.1 Name     3 Death   4 Notes   5 References      Casting ( edit )   During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call .   They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer .   Character history ( edit )   The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 .   The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love .   In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college .   On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby , as seen in the season 4 finale `` The Leap '' , he is seen in front of the classroom of students , one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother . But in the first episode of season 5 , `` Definitions '' , it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom -- Economics instead of Architecture . At the same time in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy ( Rachel Bilson ) , whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate . They see Ted enter the room , but when he announces the subject , The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off . She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom .   Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time .   Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band .   In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar .   In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding .   The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after .   The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey .   In `` Bass Player Wanted '' , the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall , carrying his son Marvin , on her way to Farhampton Inn . On their way , it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band , that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception . But the band 's leader , Darren , forced her to quit . The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band . She ends up alone at the bar , and while practicing a speech to give Darren , Darren walks up to her furious the groom 's best man punched him for `` no reason . '' Amused by this , the Mother laughs , and Darren quits the band in anger .   In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door .   In `` Gary Blauman '' , Ted and the Mother are on their first date . Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish - Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner . On the way there , Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run - in with Louis . She says that she is in the `` weirdest place on earth '' right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating . Ted walks her back to her apartment . They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away . The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her . When the story is over , they say goodnight again . The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time , before deciding to carry on their date .   In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton .   Name ( edit )   The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy .   Death ( edit )  See also : Last Forever  In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' .   A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 .   Notes ( edit )    Jump up ^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that `` Pilot '' is set .

It began on Friday , 2 April 1982 , when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands ( and , the following day , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed over them . On 5 April , the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands . The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982 , returning the islands to British control . In total , 649 Argentine military personnel , 255 British military personnel , and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities .   The conflict was a major episode in the protracted confrontation over the territories ' sovereignty . Argentina asserted ( and maintains ) that the islands are Argentine territory , and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory . The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841 . Falkland Islanders , who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century , are predominantly descendants of British settlers , and strongly favour British sovereignty . Neither state officially declared war , although both governments declared the Islands a war zone . Hostilities were almost exclusively limited to the territories under dispute and the area of the South Atlantic where they lie .   The conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books , articles , films , and songs . Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina , but the outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government , hastening its downfall . In the United Kingdom , the Conservative government , bolstered by the successful outcome , was re-elected with an increased majority the following year . The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina , where it remains a common topic for discussion .   Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid , at which the two governments issued a joint statement . No change in either country 's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit . In 1994 , Argentina 's claim to the territories was added to its constitution .

In the period leading up to the war -- and , in particular , following the transfer of power between the military dictators General Jorge Rafael Videla and General Roberto Eduardo Viola late in March 1981 -- Argentina had been in the midst of a devastating economic stagnation and large - scale civil unrest against the military junta that had been governing the country since 1976 . In December 1981 there was a further change in the Argentine military regime , bringing to office a new junta headed by General Leopoldo Galtieri ( acting president ) , Air Brigadier Basilio Lami Dozo and Admiral Jorge Anaya . Anaya was the main architect and supporter of a military solution for the long - standing claim over the islands , calculating that the United Kingdom would never respond militarily .   By opting for military action , the Galtieri government hoped to mobilise the long - standing patriotic feelings of Argentines towards the islands , and thus divert public attention from the country 's chronic economic problems and the regime 's ongoing human rights violations of the Dirty War . Such action would also bolster its dwindling legitimacy . The newspaper La Prensa speculated in a step - by - step plan beginning with cutting off supplies to the islands , ending in direct actions late in 1982 , if the UN talks were fruitless .   The ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on 19 March when a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants ( actually infiltrated by Argentine marines ) raised the Argentine flag at South Georgia Island , an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war . The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel HMS Endurance was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia on the 25th in response . The Argentine military junta , suspecting that the UK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces , ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands to be brought forward to 2 April .   The UK was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South Atlantic islands , despite repeated warnings by Royal Navy captain Nicholas Barker and others . Barker believed that Defence Secretary John Nott 's 1981 review ( in which Nott described plans to withdraw the Endurance , the UK 's only naval presence in the South Atlantic ) had sent a signal to the Argentines that the UK was unwilling , and would soon be unable , to defend its territories and subjects in the Falklands .   Argentine invasion ( edit )  Main articles : 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands , Invasion of South Georgia , Argentine air forces in the Falklands War , Argentine naval forces in the Falklands War , and Argentine ground forces in the Falklands War The Argentine destroyer ARA Santísima Trinidad landed Special Forces south of Stanley Argentinian soldiers in Port Stanley , 2 April 1982  On 2 April 1982 , Argentine forces mounted amphibious landings , known as Operation Rosario , on the Falkland Islands . The invasion was met with a nominal defence organised by the Falkland Islands ' Governor Sir Rex Hunt , giving command to Major Mike Norman of the Royal Marines . The events of the invasion included the landing of Lieutenant Commander Guillermo Sanchez - Sabarots ' Amphibious Commandos Group , the attack on Moody Brook barracks , the engagement between the troops of Hugo Santillan and Bill Trollope at Stanley , and the final engagement and surrender at Government House .   Initial British response ( edit )  Further information : British naval forces in the Falklands War , British ground forces in the Falklands War , and British air services in the Falklands War The cover of Newsweek magazine , 19 April 1982 , depicts HMS Hermes , flagship of the British Task Force . The title references the 1980 Star Wars sequel .  Word of the invasion first reached the UK from Argentine sources . A Ministry of Defence operative in London had a short telex conversation with Governor Hunt 's telex operator , who confirmed that Argentines were on the island and in control . Later that day , BBC journalist Laurie Margolis spoke with an islander at Goose Green via amateur radio , who confirmed the presence of a large Argentine fleet and that Argentine forces had taken control of the island . Operation Corporate was the codename given to the British military operations in the Falklands War . The commander of task force operations was Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse . Operations lasted from 1 April 1982 to 20 June 1982 . The British undertook a series of military operations as a means of recapturing the Falklands from Argentine occupation . The British government had taken action prior to the 2 April invasion . In response to events on South Georgia , the submarines HMS Splendid and HMS Spartan were ordered to sail south on 29 March , whereas the stores ship Royal Fleet Auxiliary ( RFA ) Fort Austin was dispatched from the Western Mediterranean to support HMS Endurance . Lord Carrington had wished to send a third submarine , but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments . Coincidentally , on 26 March , the submarine HMS Superb left Gibraltar and it was assumed in the press it was heading south . There has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before nuclear - powered submarines could be deployed .   The following day , during a crisis meeting headed by the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , the Chief of the Naval Staff , Admiral Sir Henry Leach , advised them that `` Britain could and should send a task force if the islands are invaded '' . On 1 April , Leach sent orders to a Royal Navy force carrying out exercises in the Mediterranean to prepare to sail south . Following the invasion on 2 April , after an emergency meeting of the cabinet , approval was given to form a task force to retake the islands . This was backed in an emergency session of the House of Commons the next day .   On 6 April , the British Government set up a War Cabinet to provide day - to - day political oversight of the campaign . This was the critical instrument of crisis management for the British with its remit being to `` keep under review political and military developments relating to the South Atlantic , and to report as necessary to the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee '' . Until it was dissolved on 12 August , the War Cabinet met at least daily . Although Margaret Thatcher is described as dominating the War Cabinet , Lawrence Freedman notes in the Official History of the Falklands Campaign that she did not ignore opposition or fail to consult others . However , once a decision was reached she `` did not look back '' .   Position of third party countries ( edit )   On the evening of 3 April , the United Kingdom 's United Nations ambassador Sir Anthony Parsons put a draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council . The resolution , which condemned the hostilities and demanded the immediate Argentine withdrawal from the Islands , was adopted by the council the following day as United Nations Security Council Resolution 502 , which passed with ten votes in support , one against ( Panama ) and four abstentions ( China , the Soviet Union , Poland and Spain ) . The UK received further political support from member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations and the European Economic Community . The EEC also provided economic support by imposing economic sanctions on Argentina . Argentina itself was politically backed by a majority of countries in Latin America ( though not , crucially , Chile ) and some members of the Non-Aligned Movement .   The New Zealand government expelled the Argentinian ambassador following the invasion . The Prime Minister , Robert Muldoon , was in London when the war broke out and in an opinion piece published in The Times he said : `` The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased ... New Zealand will back Britain all the way . '' Broadcasting on the BBC World Service , he told the Falkland Islanders : `` This is Rob Muldoon . We are thinking of you and we are giving our full and total support to the British Government in its endeavours to rectify this situation and get rid of the people who have invaded your country . '' On 20 May 1982 , he announced that New Zealand would make HMNZS Canterbury , a Leander - class frigate , available for use where the British thought fit to release a Royal Navy vessel for the Falklands . In the House of Commons afterwards , Margaret Thatcher said : `` ... the New Zealand Government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support for this country ( and ) the Falkland Islanders , for the rule of liberty and of law '' .   The Sierra Leone government allowed Task force ships to refuel at Freetown .   VC10 transport aircraft landed at Banjul in The Gambia while flying between the UK and Ascension Island .   France allowed UK aircraft and warships use of its port and airfield facilities at Dakar in Senegal .   The war was an unexpected event in a world strained by the Cold War and the North -- South divide . The response of some countries was the effort to mediate the crisis and later as the war began , the support ( or criticism ) based in terms of anti-colonialism , political solidarity , historical relationships or realpolitik .   The United States was concerned that a protracted conflict could draw the Soviet Union on Argentina 's side , and initially tried to mediate an end to the conflict through `` shuttle diplomacy '' . However , when Argentina refused the U.S. peace overtures , U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced that the United States would prohibit arms sales to Argentina and provide material support for British operations . Both Houses of the U.S. Congress passed resolutions supporting the U.S. action siding with the United Kingdom .   The U.S. provided the United Kingdom with military equipment ranging from submarine detectors to the latest missiles . President Ronald Reagan approved the Royal Navy 's request to borrow the Sea Harrier - capable amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima ( LPH - 2 ) if the British lost an aircraft carrier . The United States Navy developed a plan to help the British man the ship with American military contractors , likely retired sailors with knowledge of Iwo Jima 's systems .   France provided dissimilar aircraft training so Harrier pilots could train against the French aircraft used by Argentina . French and British intelligence also worked to prevent Argentina from obtaining more Exocet missiles on the international market . At the same time Peru attempted to purchase 12 missiles for Argentina , in a failed secret operation .   Chile gave support to the UK in the form of intelligence about the Argentine military and early warning intelligence on Argentine air movements . Throughout the war , Argentina was afraid of a Chilean military intervention in Patagonia and kept some of its best mountain regiments away from the Falklands near the Chilean border as a precaution .   While France overtly backed the United Kingdom , a French technical team remained in Argentina throughout the war . French government sources have said that the French team was engaged in intelligence - gathering ; however , it simultaneously provided direct material support to the Argentines , identifying and fixing faults in Exocet missile launchers . According to the book Operation Israel , advisers from Israel Aerospace Industries were already in Argentina and continued their work during the conflict . The book also claims that Israel sold weapons and drop tanks in a secret operation in Peru . Peru also openly sent `` Mirages , pilots and missiles '' to Argentina during the war . Peru had earlier transferred ten Hercules transport planes to Argentina soon after the British Task Force had set sail in April 1982 . Nick van der Bijl records that , after the Argentine defeat at Goose Green , Venezuela and Guatemala offered to send paratroopers to the Falklands . Through Libya , under Muammar Gaddafi , Argentina received 20 launchers and 60 SA - 7 missiles , as well as machine guns , mortars and mines ; all in all , the load of four trips of two Boeing 707s of the AAF , refuelled in Recife with the knowledge and consent of the Brazilian government . Some of these clandestine logistics operations were mounted by the Soviet Union .   British task force ( edit )  Main article : British logistics in the Falklands War HMS Invincible , one of two aircraft carriers that the Royal Navy had available for the task force . Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm Sea Harrier FRS1 . The gloss paint scheme was altered to a duller one en route south .  The British government had no contingency plan for an invasion of the islands , and the task force was rapidly put together from whatever vessels were available . The nuclear - powered submarine Conqueror set sail from France on 4 April , whilst the two aircraft carriers Invincible and Hermes , in the company of escort vessels , left Portsmouth only a day later . On its return to Southampton from a world cruise on 7 April , the ocean liner SS Canberra was requisitioned and set sail two days later with 3 Commando Brigade aboard . The ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2 was also requisitioned and left Southampton on 12 May with 5th Infantry Brigade on board . The whole task force eventually comprised 127 ships : 43 Royal Navy vessels , 22 Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships and 62 merchant ships .   The retaking of the Falkland Islands was considered extremely difficult . The U.S. Navy considered a successful counter-invasion by the British `` a military impossibility '' . Firstly , the British were significantly constrained by the disparity in deployable air cover . The British had 42 aircraft ( 28 Sea Harriers and 14 Harrier GR. 3s ) available for air combat operations , against approximately 122 serviceable jet fighters , of which about 50 were used as air superiority fighters and the remainder as strike aircraft , in Argentina 's air forces during the war . Crucially , the British lacked airborne early warning and control ( AEW ) aircraft . Planning also considered the Argentine surface fleet and the threat posed by Exocet - equipped vessels or the two Type 209 submarines .   By mid-April , the Royal Air Force had set up the airbase of RAF Ascension Island , co-located with Wideawake Airfield on the mid-Atlantic British overseas territory of Ascension Island , including a sizeable force of Avro Vulcan B Mk 2 bombers , Handley Page Victor K Mk 2 refuelling aircraft , and McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR Mk 2 fighters to protect them . Meanwhile , the main British naval task force arrived at Ascension to prepare for active service . A small force had already been sent south to recapture South Georgia .   Encounters began in April ; the British Task Force was shadowed by Boeing 707 aircraft of the Argentine Air Force during their travel to the south . Several of these flights were intercepted by Sea Harriers outside the British - imposed exclusion zone ; the unarmed 707s were not attacked because diplomatic moves were still in progress and the UK had not yet decided to commit itself to armed force . On 23 April , a Brazilian commercial Douglas DC - 10 from VARIG Airlines en route to South Africa was intercepted by British Harriers who visually identified the civilian plane .   Recapture of South Georgia and the attack on Santa Fe ( edit )   The South Georgia force , Operation Paraquet , under the command of Major Guy Sheridan RM , consisted of Marines from 42 Commando , a troop of the Special Air Service ( SAS ) and Special Boat Service ( SBS ) troops who were intended to land as reconnaissance forces for an invasion by the Royal Marines . All were embarked on RFA Tidespring . First to arrive was the Churchill - class submarine HMS Conqueror on 19 April , and the island was over-flown by a radar - mapping Handley Page Victor on 20 April .   The first landings of SAS troops took place on 21 April , but -- with the southern hemisphere autumn setting in -- the weather was so bad that their landings and others made the next day were all withdrawn after two helicopters crashed in fog on Fortuna Glacier . On 23 April , a submarine alert was sounded and operations were halted , with Tidespring being withdrawn to deeper water to avoid interception . On 24 April , the British forces regrouped and headed in to attack .  The ARA Santa Fe ( as USS Catfish ) in 1956  On 25 April , after resupplying the Argentine garrison in South Georgia , the submarine ARA Santa Fe was spotted on the surface by a Westland Wessex HAS Mk 3 helicopter from HMS Antrim , which attacked the Argentine submarine with depth charges . HMS Plymouth launched a Westland Wasp HAS. Mk. 1 helicopter , and HMS Brilliant launched a Westland Lynx HAS Mk 2 . The Lynx launched a torpedo , and strafed the submarine with its pintle - mounted general purpose machine gun ; the Wessex also fired on Santa Fe with its GPMG . The Wasp from HMS Plymouth as well as two other Wasps launched from HMS Endurance fired AS - 12 ASM antiship missiles at the submarine , scoring hits . Santa Fe was damaged badly enough to prevent her from diving . The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty at King Edward Point on South Georgia .   With Tidespring now far out to sea , and the Argentine forces augmented by the submarine 's crew , Major Sheridan decided to gather the 76 men he had and make a direct assault that day . After a short forced march by the British troops and a naval bombardment demonstration by two Royal Navy vessels ( Antrim and Plymouth ) , the Argentine forces surrendered without resistance . The message sent from the naval force at South Georgia to London was , `` Be pleased to inform Her Majesty that the White Ensign flies alongside the Union Jack in South Georgia . God Save the Queen . '' The Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher , broke the news to the media , telling them to `` Just rejoice at that news , and congratulate our forces and the Marines ! ''   Black Buck raids ( edit )  Main article : Operation Black Buck RAF Avro Vulcan B. Mk. 2 strategic bomber  On 1 May , British operations on the Falklands opened with the `` Black Buck 1 '' attack ( of a series of five ) on the airfield at Stanley . A Vulcan bomber from Ascension flew on an 8,000 - nautical - mile ( 15,000 km ; 9,200 mi ) round trip dropping conventional bombs across the runway at Stanley and back to Ascension . The mission required repeated refuelling , and required several Victor K2 tanker aircraft operating in concert , including tanker to tanker refuelling . The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine , and the raids consumed precious tanker resources from Ascension , but also prevented Argentina from stationing fast jets on the islands .   The raids did minimal damage to the runway , and damage to radars was quickly repaired . As of 2014 the Royal Air Force Web site stated that all the three bombing missions had been successful , but historian Lawrence Freedman , who had access to classified documents , said in a 2005 book that the subsequent bombing missions were failures . Argentine sources said that the Vulcan raids influenced Argentina to withdraw some of its Mirage IIIs from Southern Argentina to the Buenos Aires Defence Zone . This was later described as propaganda by Falklands veteran Commander Nigel Ward . In any case , the effect of the Vulcan raids on Argentina 's deployment of defensive fighters was watered down when British officials made clear that there would be no strikes on air bases in Argentina .   Of the five Black Buck raids , three were against Stanley Airfield , with the other two anti-radar missions using Shrike anti-radiation missiles .   Escalation of the air War ( edit )  French - built Super Étendard of the Argentine Naval Aviation  The Falklands had only three airfields . The longest and only paved runway was at the capital , Stanley , and even that was too short to support fast jets ( although an arrestor gear was fitted in April to support Skyhawks ) . Therefore , the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland , severely hampering their efforts at forward staging , combat air patrols , and close air support over the islands . The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low , and they were later compelled to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands .   The first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft ( A-4 Skyhawks , IAI Daggers , English Electric Canberras , and Mirage III escorts ) , and was sent on 1 May , in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place . Only a section of Grupo 6 ( flying IAI Dagger aircraft ) found ships , which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands . The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely . This greatly boosted morale of the Argentine pilots , who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships , protected by radar ground clutter from the Islands and by using a late pop up profile . Meanwhile , other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by BAE Sea Harriers operating from HMS Invincible . A Dagger and a Canberra were shot down .   Combat broke out between Sea Harrier FRS Mk 1 fighters of No. 801 Naval Air Squadron and Mirage III fighters of Grupo 8 . Both sides refused to fight at the other 's best altitude , until two Mirages finally descended to engage . One was shot down by an AIM - 9L Sidewinder air - to - air missile ( AAM ) , while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland air base . The plane made for Stanley , where it fell victim to friendly fire from the Argentine defenders .   As a result of this experience , Argentine Air Force staff decided to employ A-4 Skyhawks and Daggers only as strike units , the Canberras only during the night , and Mirage IIIs ( without air refuelling capability or any capable AAM ) as decoys to lure away the British Sea Harriers . The decoying would be later extended with the formation of the Escuadrón Fénix , a squadron of civilian jets flying 24 hours - a-day simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet . On one of these flights on 7 June , an Air Force Learjet 35A was shot down , killing the squadron commander , Vice Commodore Rodolfo De La Colina , the highest - ranking Argentine officer to die in the war . Stanley was used as an Argentine strongpoint throughout the conflict . Despite the Black Buck and Harrier raids on Stanley airfield ( no fast jets were stationed there for air defence ) and overnight shelling by detached ships , it was never out of action entirely . Stanley was defended by a mixture of surface - to - air missile ( SAM ) systems ( Franco - German Roland and British Tigercat ) and Swiss - built Oerlikon 35 mm twin anti-aircraft cannons . Lockheed Hercules transport night flights brought supplies , weapons , vehicles , and fuel , and airlifted out the wounded up until the end of the conflict .   The only Argentine Hercules shot down by the British was lost on 1 June when TC - 63 was intercepted by a Sea Harrier in daylight when it was searching for the British fleet north - east of the islands after the Argentine Navy retired its last SP - 2H Neptune due to airframe attrition .   Various options to attack the home base of the five Argentine Etendards at Río Grande were examined and discounted ( Operation Mikado ) , subsequently five Royal Navy submarines lined up , submerged , on the edge of Argentina 's 12 - nautical - mile ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) territorial limit to provide early warning of bombing raids on the British task force .   Sinking of ARA General Belgrano ( edit )  ARA General Belgrano , sinking Alferez Sobral  Two British naval task forces ( one of surface vessels and one of submarines ) and the Argentine fleet were operating in the neighbourhood of the Falklands and soon came into conflict . The first naval loss was the Second World War - vintage Argentine light cruiser ARA General Belgrano . The nuclear - powered submarine HMS Conqueror sank General Belgrano on 2 May . Three hundred and twenty - three members of General Belgrano 's crew died in the incident . More than 700 men were rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather . The losses from General Belgrano totalled nearly half of the Argentine deaths in the Falklands conflict and the loss of the ship hardened the stance of the Argentine government .   Regardless of controversies over the sinking -- including disagreement about the exact nature of the maritime exclusion zone and whether General Belgrano had been returning to port at the time of the sinking -- it had a crucial strategic effect : the elimination of the Argentine naval threat . After her loss , the entire Argentine fleet , with the exception of the conventional submarine ARA San Luis , returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting . The two escorting destroyers and the battle group centred on the aircraft carrier ARA Veinticinco de Mayo both withdrew from the area , ending the direct threat to the British fleet that their pincer movement had represented .   However , settling the controversy in 2003 , the ship 's captain Hector Bonzo confirmed that General Belgrano had actually been manoeuvering , not `` sailing away '' from the exclusion zone , and had orders to sink `` any British ship he could find '' . Further , Captain Bonzo stated that any suggestion that HMS Conqueror 's actions were a `` betrayal '' was utterly wrong ; rather , the submarine carried out its duties according to the accepted rules of war .   In a separate incident later that night , British forces engaged an Argentine patrol gunboat , the ARA Alferez Sobral , that was searching for the crew of the Argentine Air Force Canberra light bomber shot down on 1 May . Two Royal Navy Lynx helicopters fired four Sea Skua missiles at her . Badly damaged and with eight crew dead , Alferez Sobral managed to return to Puerto Deseado two days later . The Canberra 's crew were never found .   Sinking of HMS Sheffield ( edit )  HMS Sheffield  On 4 May , two days after the sinking of General Belgrano , the British lost the Type 42 destroyer HMS Sheffield to fire following an Exocet missile strike from the Argentine 2nd Naval Air Fighter / Attack Squadron . Sheffield had been ordered forward with two other Type 42s to provide a long - range radar and medium - high altitude missile picket far from the British carriers . She was struck amidships , with devastating effect , ultimately killing 20 crew members and severely injuring 24 others . The ship was abandoned several hours later , gutted and deformed by the fires that continued to burn for six more days . She finally sank outside the Maritime Exclusion Zone on 10 May .   The incident is described in detail by Admiral Sandy Woodward in his book One Hundred Days , in Chapter One . Woodward was a former commanding officer of Sheffield . The destruction of Sheffield ( the first Royal Navy ship sunk in action since the Second World War ) had a profound impact on the British public , bringing home the fact that the `` Falklands Crisis '' , as the BBC News put it , was now an actual `` shooting war '' .   The tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations ' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentinians . The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary General Pérez de Cuéllar on 18 May 1982 . In it , the British abandoned their previous `` red - line '' that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentinian forces , as supported by United Nations Security Council Resolution 502 . Instead , it proposed a UN administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both Argentinian and British forces , then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands , including Argentines , although no Argentines lived there . Reference to `` self - determination '' of the islanders was dropped and the British proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the UN .   British Special forces operations ( edit )   Given the threat to the British fleet posed by the Etendard - Exocet combination , plans were made to use C - 130s to fly in some SAS troops to attack the home base of the five Etendards at Río Grande , Tierra del Fuego . The operation was codenamed `` Mikado '' . The operation was later scrapped , after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited , and replaced with a plan to use the submarine HMS Onyx to drop SAS operatives several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina 's remaining Exocet stockpile .   An SAS reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a seaborne infiltration . A Westland Sea King helicopter carrying the assigned team took off from HMS Invincible on the night of 17 May , but bad weather forced it to land 50 miles ( 80 km ) from its target and the mission was aborted . The pilot flew to Chile , landed south of Punta Arenas , and dropped off the SAS team . The helicopter 's crew of three then destroyed the aircraft , surrendered to Chilean police on 25 May , and were repatriated to the UK after interrogation . The discovery of the burnt - out helicopter attracted considerable international attention . Meanwhile , the SAS team crossed the border and penetrated into Argentina , but cancelled their mission after the Argentines suspected an SAS operation and deployed some 2,000 troops to search for them . The SAS men were able to return to Chile , and took a civilian flight back to the UK .   On 14 May the SAS carried out a raid on Pebble Island on the Falklands , where the Argentine Navy had taken over a grass airstrip for FMA IA 58 Pucará light ground - attack aircraft and Beechcraft T - 34 Mentors , which resulted in the destruction of several aircraft .   Land battles ( edit )   Landing at San Carlos -- bomb Alley ( edit )  Main articles : Operation Sutton and Battle of San Carlos British sailors in anti-flash gear at action stations on HMS Cardiff near San Carlos , June 1982 .  During the night of 21 May , the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore Michael Clapp ( Commodore , Amphibious Warfare -- COMAW ) mounted Operation Sutton , the amphibious landing on beaches around San Carlos Water , on the northwestern coast of East Falkland facing onto Falkland Sound . The bay , known as Bomb Alley by British forces , was the scene of repeated air attacks by low - flying Argentine jets .   The 4,000 men of 3 Commando Brigade were put ashore as follows : 2nd Battalion , Parachute Regiment ( 2 Para ) from the RORO ferry Norland and 40 Commando Royal Marines from the amphibious ship HMS Fearless were landed at San Carlos ( Blue Beach ) , 3rd Battalion , Parachute Regiment ( 3 Para ) from the amphibious ship HMS Intrepid was landed at Port San Carlos ( Green Beach ) and 45 Commando from RFA Stromness was landed at Ajax Bay ( Red Beach ) . Notably , the waves of eight LCUs and eight LCVPs were led by Major Ewen Southby - Tailyour , who had commanded the Falklands detachment NP8901 from March 1978 to 1979 . 42 Commando on the ocean liner SS Canberra was a tactical reserve . Units from the Royal Artillery , Royal Engineers , etc. and armoured reconnaissance vehicles were also put ashore with the landing craft , the Round Table class LSL and mexeflote barges . Rapier missile launchers were carried as underslung loads of Sea Kings for rapid deployment .   By dawn the next day , they had established a secure beachhead from which to conduct offensive operations . From there , Brigadier Julian Thompson 's plan was to capture Darwin and Goose Green before turning towards Port Stanley . Now , with the British troops on the ground , the Argentine Air Force began the night bombing campaign against them using Canberra bomber planes until the last day of the war ( 14 June ) .  HMS Antelope smoking after being hit , 23 May HMS Coventry  At sea , the paucity of the British ships ' anti-aircraft defences was demonstrated in the sinking of HMS Ardent on 21 May , HMS Antelope on 24 May , and MV Atlantic Conveyor ( struck by two AM39 Exocets ) on 25 May along with a vital cargo of helicopters , runway - building equipment and tents . The loss of all but one of the Chinook helicopters being carried by the Atlantic Conveyor was a severe blow from a logistical perspective .   Also lost on this day was HMS Coventry , a sister to Sheffield , whilst in company with HMS Broadsword after being ordered to act as a decoy to draw away Argentine aircraft from other ships at San Carlos Bay . HMS Argonaut and HMS Brilliant were badly damaged . However , many British ships escaped being sunk because of weaknesses of the Argentine pilots ' bombing tactics described below .   To avoid the highest concentration of British air defences , Argentine pilots released ordnance from very low altitude , and hence their bomb fuzes did not have sufficient time to arm before impact . The low release of the retarded bombs ( some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier ) meant that many never exploded , as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves .   A simple free - fall bomb in a low altitude release , impacts almost directly below the aircraft , which is then within the lethal fragmentation zone of the explosion . A retarded bomb has a small parachute or air brake that opens to reduce the speed of the bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the bomb and the aircraft . The fuze for a retarded bomb requires that the retarder be open a minimum time to ensure safe separation . The pilots would have been aware of this -- but due to the high concentration required to avoid SAMs , Anti-Aircraft Artillery ( AAA ) , and British Sea Harriers , many failed to climb to the necessary release point . The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised retarding devices , allowing the pilots to effectively employ low - level bombing attacks on 8 June .   In his autobiographical account of the Falklands War , Admiral Woodward blamed the BBC World Service for disclosing information that led the Argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs . The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a Ministry of Defence official . He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being `` fearless seekers after truth '' than with the lives of British servicemen . Colonel ' H ' . Jones levelled similar accusations against the BBC after they disclosed the impending British attack on Goose Green by 2 Para .   Thirteen bombs hit British ships without detonating . Lord Craig , the retired Marshal of the Royal Air Force , is said to have remarked : `` Six better fuses and we would have lost '' although Ardent and Antelope were both lost despite the failure of bombs to explode . The fuzes were functioning correctly , and the bombs were simply released from too low an altitude . The Argentines lost 22 aircraft in the attacks .   Battle of Goose Green ( edit )  Infantry deployment in East Falklands after landing in San Carlos Main article : Battle of Goose Green  From early on 27 May until 28 May , 2 Para , ( approximately 500 men ) with naval gunfire support from HMS Arrow and artillery support from 8 Commando Battery , Royal Artillery , approached and attacked Darwin and Goose Green , which was held by the Argentine 12th Infantry Regiment . After a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the next day , the British won the battle ; in all , 17 British and 47 Argentine soldiers were killed . In total 961 Argentine troops ( including 202 Argentine Air Force personnel of the Condor airfield ) were taken prisoner .   The BBC announced the taking of Goose Green on the BBC World Service before it had actually happened . It was during this attack that Lieutenant Colonel H. Jones , the commanding officer of 2 Para , was killed at the head of his battalion while charging into the well - prepared Argentine positions . He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross .   With the sizeable Argentine force at Goose Green out of the way , British forces were now able to break out of the San Carlos beachhead . On 27 May , men of 45 Cdo and 3 Para started a loaded march across East Falkland towards the coastal settlement of Teal Inlet .   Special forces on Mount Kent ( edit )   Meanwhile , 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent . Unknown to senior British officers , the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area , and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with Blowpipe surface - to - air missiles and commandos ( 602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron ) to Stanley . This operation was known as Operation Autoimpuesta ( `` Self - determination initiative '' ) .   For the next week , the SAS and the Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre ( M&AWC ) of 3 Commando Brigade waged intense patrol battles with patrols of the volunteers ' 602nd Commando Company under Major Aldo Rico , normally second in Command of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Regiment . Throughout 30 May , Royal Air Force Harriers were active over Mount Kent . One of them , Harrier XZ963 , flown by Squadron Leader Jerry Pook -- in responding to a call for help from D Squadron , attacked Mount Kent 's eastern lower slopes , and that led to its loss through small - arms fire . Pook was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross .   The Argentine Navy used their last AM39 Exocet missile attempting to attack HMS Invincible on 30 May . There are Argentine claims that the missile struck ; however , the British have denied this , some citing that HMS Avenger shot it down . When Invincible returned to the UK after the war , she showed no signs of missile damage .   On 31 May , the M&AWC defeated Argentine Special Forces at the skirmish at Top Malo House . A 13 - strong Argentine Army Commando detachment ( Captain José Vercesi 's 1st Assault Section , 602nd Commando Company ) found itself trapped in a small shepherd 's house at Top Malo . The Argentine commandos fired from windows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed 200 metres ( 700 ft ) from the burning house . Completely surrounded , they fought 19 M&AWC marines under Captain Rod Boswell for 45 minutes until , with their ammunition almost exhausted , they elected to surrender .   Three Cadre members were badly wounded . On the Argentine side , there were two dead , including Lieutenant Ernesto Espinoza and Sergeant Mateo Sbert ( who were posthumously decorated for their bravery ) . Only five Argentines were left unscathed . As the British mopped up Top Malo House , Lieutenant Fraser Haddow 's M&AWC patrol came down from Malo Hill , brandishing a large Union Flag . One wounded Argentine soldier , Lieutenant Horacio Losito , commented that their escape route would have taken them through Haddow 's position .   601st Commando tried to move forward to rescue 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain . Spotted by 42 Commando , they were engaged with L16 81mm mortars and forced to withdraw to Two Sisters mountain . The leader of 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain realised his position had become untenable and after conferring with fellow officers ordered a withdrawal .   The Argentine operation also saw the extensive use of helicopter support to position and extract patrols ; the 601st Combat Aviation Battalion also suffered casualties . At about 11 : 00 am on 30 May , an Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma helicopter was brought down by a shoulder - launched FIM - 92 Stinger surface - to - air missile ( SAM ) fired by the SAS in the vicinity of Mount Kent . Six Argentine National Gendarmerie Special Forces were killed and eight more wounded in the crash .   As Brigadier Thompson commented , `` It was fortunate that I had ignored the views expressed by Northwood HQ that reconnaissance of Mount Kent before insertion of 42 Commando was superfluous . Had D Squadron not been there , the Argentine Special Forces would have caught the Commando before de-planing and , in the darkness and confusion on a strange landing zone , inflicted heavy casualties on men and helicopters . ''   Bluff Cove and Fitzroy ( edit )  Main article : Bluff Cove Air Attacks  By 1 June , with the arrival of a further 5,000 British troops of the 5th Infantry Brigade , the new British divisional commander , Major General Jeremy Moore RM , had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against Stanley . During this build - up , the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued , killing 56 . Of the dead , 32 were from the Welsh Guards on RFA Sir Galahad and RFA Sir Tristram on 8 June . According to Surgeon - Commander Rick Jolly of the Falklands Field Hospital , more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack , including , famously , Simon Weston .   The Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to Stanley . On 2 June , a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house in a number of Army Westland Scout helicopters . Telephoning ahead to Fitzroy , they discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and ( exceeding their authority ) commandeered the one remaining RAF Chinook helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy ( a settlement on Port Pleasant ) and Bluff Cove ( a settlement on Port Fitzroy ) .   This uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation , as they now found themselves with a 30 miles ( 48 km ) string of indefensible positions on their southern flank . Support could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already heavily oversubscribed . The soldiers could march , but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea .   Plans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2 June , whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to be ferried from San Carlos Water in the Landing Ship Logistics ( LSL ) Sir Tristram and the landing platform dock ( LPD ) Intrepid on the night of 5 June . Intrepid was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of Sir Tristram as possible , leaving the next evening for the relative safety of San Carlos . Escorts would be provided for this day , after which Sir Tristram would be left to unload using a Mexeflote ( a powered raft ) for as long as it took to finish .   Political pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore Clapp to alter this plan . Two lower - value LSLs would be sent , but with no suitable beaches to land on , Intrepid 's landing craft would need to accompany them to unload . A complicated operation across several nights with Intrepid and her sister ship Fearless sailing half - way to dispatch their craft was devised .   The attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed , possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment . They returned to San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when Fearless dispatched her landing craft . Sir Tristram sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by Sir Galahad at dawn on 7 June . Anchored 1,200 feet ( 370 m ) apart in Port Pleasant , the landing ships were near Fitzroy , the designated landing point .   The landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly , but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point ( the first half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove ) resulted in the senior Welsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy / Bluff Cove . The alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff Cove bridge ( destroyed by retreating Argentine combat engineers ) to their destination , a journey of around seven miles ( 11 km ) .   On Sir Galahad 's stern ramp there was an argument about what to do . The officers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove that day . They were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft . It would take 20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote . They would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait until dark to sail there . The officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail . They refused to take their men off the ship . They possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board Sir Galahad of the Royal Engineer Troop whose job it was to repair the bridge . The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion , who were potentially facing the enemy without their support . They had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at San Carlos and may have been overconfident in the air defences . Ewen Southby - Tailyour gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach , the order was ignored .   The longer journey time of the landing craft taking the troops directly to Bluff Cove and the squabbling over how the landing was to be performed caused an enormous delay in unloading . This had disastrous consequences . Without escorts , having not yet established their air defence , and still almost fully laden , the two LSLs in Port Pleasant were sitting targets for two waves of Argentine A-4 Skyhawks .   The disaster at Port Pleasant ( although often known as Bluff Cove ) would provide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as TV news video footage showed Navy helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships .  HMS Cardiff anchored outside Port Stanley at the end of hostilities in 1982  British casualties were 48 killed and 115 wounded . Three Argentine pilots were also killed . The air strike delayed the scheduled British ground attack on Stanley by two days . Argentine General Mario Menéndez , commander of Argentine forces in the Falklands , was told that 900 British soldiers had died . He expected that the losses would cause enemy morale to drop and the British assault to stall .   Fall of Stanley ( edit )  See also : Argentine surrender in the Falklands War The road to Stanley Argentine prisoners of war -- Port Stanley  On the night of 11 June , after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build - up , British forces launched a brigade - sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley . Units of 3 Commando Brigade , supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships , simultaneously attacked in the Battle of Mount Harriet , Battle of Two Sisters , and Battle of Mount Longdon . Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers . At Two Sisters , the British faced both enemy resistance and friendly fire , but managed to capture their objectives . The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon . British forces were bogged down by assault rifle , mortar , machine gun , artillery fire , sniper fire , and ambushes . Despite this , the British continued their advance .   During this battle , 13 were killed when HMS Glamorgan , straying too close to shore while returning from the gun line , was struck by an improvised trailer - based Exocet MM38 launcher taken from the destroyer ARA Seguí by Argentine Navy technicians . On the same day , Sergeant Ian McKay of 4 Platoon , B Company , 3 Para died in a grenade attack on an Argentine bunker , which earned him a posthumous Victoria Cross . After a night of fierce fighting , all objectives were secured . Both sides suffered heavy losses .   The night of 13 June saw the start of the second phase of attacks , in which the momentum of the initial assault was maintained . 2 Para , with light armour support from the Blues and Royals , captured Wireless Ridge , with the loss of 3 British and 25 Argentine lives , and the 2nd battalion , Scots Guards captured Mount Tumbledown at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown , which cost 10 British and 30 Argentine lives .  A pile of discarded Argentine weapons in Port Stanley  With the last natural defence line at Mount Tumbledown breached , the Argentine town defences of Stanley began to falter . In the morning gloom , one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent . Private Santiago Carrizo of the 3rd Regiment described how a platoon commander ordered them to take up positions in the houses and `` if a Kelper resists , shoot him '' , but the entire company did nothing of the kind .   A ceasefire was declared on 14 June and the commander of the Argentine garrison in Stanley , Brigade General Mario Menéndez , surrendered to Major General Jeremy Moore the same day .   Recapture of South Sandwich Islands ( edit )  Main article : Operation Keyhole The Argentine Thule Garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base  On 20 June , the British retook the South Sandwich Islands , which involved accepting the surrender of the Southern Thule Garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base , and declared hostilities over . Argentina had established Corbeta Uruguay in 1976 , but prior to 1982 the United Kingdom had contested the existence of the Argentine base only through diplomatic channels .   Casualties ( edit )  The Argentine Military Cemetery , on East Falkland The British Military Cemetery at San Carlos on East Falkland  In total 907 were killed during the 74 days of the conflict :    Argentina -- 649   Ejército Argentino ( Army ) -- 194 ( 16 officers , 35 non-commissioned officers ( NCO ) and 143 conscript privates )   Armada de la República Argentina ( Navy ) -- 341 ( including 321 in ARA General Belgrano and 4 naval aviators )   IMARA ( Marines ) -- 34     Fuerza Aérea Argentina ( Air Force ) -- 55 ( including 31 pilots and 14 ground crew )   Gendarmería Nacional Argentina ( Border Guard ) -- 7   Prefectura Naval Argentina ( Coast Guard ) -- 2   Civilian sailors -- 16     United Kingdom -- A total of 255 British servicemen and 3 female Falkland Island civilians were killed during the Falklands War .   Royal Navy -- 86 + 2 Hong Kong laundrymen ( see below )   Royal Marines -- 27 ( 2 officers , 14 NCOs and 11 marines )   Royal Fleet Auxiliary -- 4 + 6 Hong Kong sailors   Merchant Navy -- 6   British Army -- 123 ( 7 officers , 40 NCOs and 76 privates )   Royal Air Force -- 1 ( 1 officer )   Falkland Islands civilians -- 3 women killed by friendly fire      Of the 86 Royal Navy personnel , 22 were lost in HMS Ardent , 19 + 1 lost in HMS Sheffield , 19 + 1 lost in HMS Coventry and 13 lost in HMS Glamorgan . Fourteen naval cooks were among the dead , the largest number from any one branch in the Royal Navy .   Thirty - three of the British Army 's dead came from the Welsh Guards ( 32 of which died on the RFA Sir Galahad in the Bluff Cove Air Attacks ) , 21 from the 3rd Battalion , the Parachute Regiment , 18 from the 2nd Battalion , the Parachute Regiment , 19 from the Special Air Service , 3 from Royal Signals and 8 from each of the Scots Guards and Royal Engineers . The 1st battalion / 7th Duke of Edinburgh 's Own Gurkha Rifles lost one man .   Two more British deaths may be attributed to Operation Corporate , bringing the total to 260 :    Captain Brian Biddick from SS Uganda underwent an emergency operation on the voyage to the Falklands . Later he was repatriated by an RAF medical flight to the hospital at Wroughton where he died on 12 May .   Paul Mills from HMS Coventry suffered from complications from a skull fracture sustained in the sinking of his ship and died on 29 March 1983 ; he is buried in his home town of Swavesey .    There were 1,188 Argentine and 777 British non-fatal casualties .   Further information about the field hospitals and hospital ships is at Ajax Bay and List of hospitals and hospital ships of the Royal Navy . On the Argentine side beside the Military Hospital at Port Stanley , the Argentine Air Force Mobile Field Hospital was deployed at Comodoro Rivadavia .   Red Cross Box ( edit )       This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( February 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Before British offensive operations began , the British and Argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side . This area , a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter , was referred to as the Red Cross Box ( 48 ° 30 ′ S 53 ° 45 ′ W \\ufeff / \\ufeff 48.500 ° S 53.750 ° W \\ufeff / - 48.500 ; - 53.750 ) , about 45 miles ( 72 km ) north of Falkland Sound . Ultimately , the British stationed four ships ( HMS Hydra , HMS Hecla and HMS Herald and the primary hospital ship SS Uganda ) within the box , while the Argentines stationed three ( ARA Almirante Irízar , Bahia Paraiso and Puerto Deseado ) .  Hecla at HM Naval Base Gibraltar , during conversion to a hospital ship for service during the Falklands War  The hospital ships were non-warships converted to serve as hospital ships . The three British naval vessels were survey vessels and Uganda was a passenger liner . Almirante Irizar was an icebreaker , Bahia Paraiso was an Antarctic supply transport and Puerto Deseado was a survey ship . The British and Argentine vessels operating within the Box were in radio contact and there was some transfer of patients between the hospital ships . For example , the Uganda on four occasions transferred patients to an Argentine hospital ship . The British naval hospital ships operated as casualty ferries , carrying casualties from both sides from the Falklands to Uganda and operating a shuttle service between the Red Cross Box and Montevideo .   Throughout the conflict officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the Geneva Conventions . On 12 June , some personnel were transferred from the Argentine hospital ship to the British ships by helicopter . Argentine naval officers also inspected the British casualty ferries in the estuary of the River Plate .   British casualty evacuation ( edit )   Hydra worked with Hecla and Herald , to take casualties from Uganda to Montevideo , Uruguay , where a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances met them . RAF VC10 aircraft then flew the casualties to the UK for transfer to the Princess Alexandra Hospital at RAF Wroughton , near Swindon .   Aftermath ( edit )  Main article : Aftermath of the Falklands War The Monumento a los Caídos en Malvinas ( `` Monument for the Fallen in the Falklands '' ) in Plaza San Martín , Buenos Aires ; a member of the historic Patricios regiment stands guard  This brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved , besides the considerable casualty rate and large materiel loss , especially of shipping and aircraft , relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides .   In the United Kingdom , Margaret Thatcher 's popularity increased . The success of the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the Conservative government , who had been trailing behind the SDP - Liberal Alliance in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began , but after the success in the Falklands the Conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win the following year 's general election by a landslide . Subsequently , Defence Secretary Nott 's proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned .   The islanders subsequently had full British citizenship restored in 1983 , their lifestyle was improved by investments the UK made after the war and by the liberalisation of economic measures that had been stalled through fear of angering Argentina . In 1985 , a new constitution was enacted promoting self - government , which has continued to devolve power to the islanders .  The 1982 Liberation Memorial in Stanley , Falkland Islands  In Argentina , the Falklands War meant that a possible war with Chile was avoided . Further , Argentina returned to a democratic government in the 1983 general election , the first free general election since 1973 . It also had a major social impact , destroying the military 's image as the `` moral reserve of the nation '' that they had maintained through most of the 20th century .   Various figures have been produced for the number of veterans who have committed suicide since the war . Some studies have estimated that 264 British veterans and 350 -- 500 Argentine veterans have committed suicide since 1982 . However , a detailed study of 21,432 British veterans of the war commissioned by the UK Ministry of Defence found that only 95 had died from `` intentional self - harm and events of undetermined intent ( suicides and open verdict deaths ) '' , a proportion lower than would be expected within the general population over the same period .   Military Analysis ( edit )   Militarily , the Falklands conflict remains the largest air - naval combat operation between modern forces since the end of the Second World War . As such , it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians . The most significant `` lessons learned '' include : the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines , the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for a long - distance projection of power , and reconfirmation of the role of tactical air power , including the use of helicopters .   In 1986 , the BBC broadcast the Horizon programme , In the Wake of HMS Sheffield , which discussed lessons learned from the conflict , and measures since taken to implement them , such as stealth ships and close - in weapon systems .   Memorials ( edit )   There are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves , the most notable of which is the 1982 Liberation Memorial , unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war . It lists the names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the Secretariat Building in Stanley , overlooking Stanley Harbour . The Memorial was funded entirely by the Islanders and is inscribed with the words `` In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us '' .   In addition to memorials on the islands , there is a memorial in the crypt of St Paul 's Cathedral , London to the British war dead . The Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel at Pangbourne College was opened in March 2000 as a commemoration of the lives and sacrifice of all those who served and died in the South Atlantic in 1982 . In Argentina , there is a memorial at Plaza San Martín in Buenos Aires , another one in Rosario , and a third one in Ushuaia .   During the war , British dead were put into plastic body bags and buried in mass graves . After the war , the bodies were recovered ; 14 were reburied at Blue Beach Military Cemetery and 64 were returned to the UK .   Many of the Argentine dead are buried in the Argentine Military Cemetery west of the Darwin Settlement . The government of Argentina declined an offer by the UK to have the bodies repatriated to the mainland .   Minefields ( edit )  Although some minefields have been cleared , a substantial number of them still exist in the islands , such as this one at Port William on East Falkland .  As of 2011 , there were 113 uncleared minefields on the Falkland Islands and unexploded ordnance ( UXOs ) covering an area of 13 km ( 5.0 sq mi ) . Of this area , 5.5 km ( 2.1 sq mi ) on the Murrell Peninsula were classified as being `` suspected minefields '' -- the area had been heavily pastured for the previous 25 years without incident . It was estimated that these minefields had 20,000 anti-personnel mines and 5,000 anti-tank mines . No human casualties from mines or UXO have been reported in the Falkland Islands since 1984 , and no civilian mine casualties have ever occurred on the islands . The UK reported six military personnel were injured in 1982 and a further two injured in 1983 . Most military accidents took place while clearing the minefields in the immediate aftermath of the 1982 conflict or in the process of trying to establish the extent of the minefield perimeters , particularly where no detailed records existed .   On 9 May 2008 , the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields , which represent 0.1 % of the available farmland on the islands `` present no long term social or economic difficulties for the Falklands , '' and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them . However , the British Government , in accordance with its commitments under the Mine Ban Treaty has a commitment to clear the mines by the end of 2019 . In May 2012 , it was announced that 3.7 km ( 1.4 sq mi ) of Stanley Common ( which lies between the Stanley -- Mount Pleasant road and the shoreline ) was made safe and had been opened to the public , opening up a 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) stretch of coastline and a further two kilometres of shoreline along Mullet 's Creek .   Press and publicity ( edit )   Argentina ( edit )  Gente 's `` Estamos ganando '' headline ( `` We 're winning '' )  Selected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war . Back in Buenos Aires , newspapers and magazines faithfully reported on `` the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes '' .   Officers from the intelligence services were attached to the newspapers and ' leaked ' information confirming the official communiqués from the government . The glossy magazines Gente and Siete Días swelled to 60 pages with colour photographs of British warships in flames -- many of them faked -- and bogus eyewitness reports of the Argentine commandos ' guerrilla war on South Georgia ( 6 May ) and an already dead Pucará pilot 's attack on HMS Hermes ( Lt. Daniel Antonio Jukic had been killed at Goose Green during a British air strike on 1 May ) . Most of the faked photos actually came from the tabloid press . One of the best remembered headlines was `` Estamos ganando '' ( `` We 're winning '' ) from the magazine Gente , that would later use variations of it .   The Argentine troops on the Falkland Islands could read Gaceta Argentina -- a newspaper intended to boost morale among the servicemen . Some of its untruths could easily be unveiled by the soldiers who recovered corpses .   The Malvinas cause united the Argentines in a patriotic atmosphere that protected the junta from critics , and even opponents of the military government supported Galtieri ; Ernesto Sabato said : `` Do n't be mistaken , Europe ; it is not a dictatorship who is fighting for the Malvinas , it is the whole Nation . Opponents of the military dictatorship , like me , are fighting to extirpate the last trace of colonialism . '' The Madres de Plaza de Mayo were even exposed to death threats from ordinary people .   HMS Invincible was repeatedly sunk in the Argentine press , and on 30 April 1982 the Argentine magazine Tal Cual showed Prime Minister Thatcher with an eyepatch and the text : Pirate , witch and assassin . Guilty ! Three British reporters sent to Argentina to cover the war from the Argentine perspective were jailed until the end of the war .   United Kingdom ( edit )  The Sun 's infamous `` Gotcha '' headline  Seventeen newspaper reporters , two photographers , two radio reporters and three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to the war . The Newspaper Publishers ' Association selected them from among 160 applicants , excluding foreign media . The hasty selection resulted in the inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in Queen Elizabeth II 's son Prince Andrew , who was serving in the conflict . The Prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions , including anti-surface warfare , Exocet missile decoy and casualty evacuation .   Merchant vessels had the civilian Inmarsat uplink , which enabled written telex and voice report transmissions via satellite . SS Canberra had a facsimile machine that was used to upload 202 pictures from the South Atlantic over the course of the war . The Royal Navy leased bandwidth on the U.S. Defense Satellite Communications System for worldwide communications . Television demands a thousand times the data rate of telephone , but the Ministry of Defence was unsuccessful in convincing the U.S. to allocate more bandwidth .   TV producers suspected that the enquiry was half - hearted ; since the Vietnam War television pictures of casualties and traumatised soldiers were recognised as having negative propaganda value . However , the technology only allowed uploading a single frame per 20 minutes -- and only if the military satellites were allocated 100 % to television transmissions . Videotapes were shipped to Ascension Island , where a broadband satellite uplink was available , resulting in TV coverage being delayed by three weeks .   The press was very dependent on the Royal Navy , and was censored on site . Many reporters in the UK knew more about the war than those with the Task Force .   The Royal Navy expected Fleet Street to conduct a Second World War - style positive news campaign but the majority of the British media , especially the BBC , reported the war in a neutral fashion . These reporters referred to `` the British troops '' and `` the Argentinian troops '' instead of `` our lads '' and the `` Argies '' . The two main tabloid papers presented opposing viewpoints : The Daily Mirror was decidedly anti-war , whilst The Sun became well known for headlines such as `` Stick It Up Your Junta ! , '' which , along with the reporting in other tabloids , led to accusations of xenophobia and jingoism . The Sun was condemned for its `` Gotcha '' headline following the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano .   Cultural impact ( edit )  Main article : Cultural impact of the Falklands War  There were wide - ranging influences on popular culture in both the UK and Argentina , from the immediate postwar period to the present . The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges described the war as `` a fight between two bald men over a comb '' . The words yomp and Exocet entered the British vernacular as a result of the war . The Falklands War also provided material for theatre , film and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians . In Argentina , the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the English language , giving way to the rise of local rock musicians .

In fact Argentine AAA at Stanley shot down the Mirage when it tried an emergency landing there . It was a blatant lie for all those Argentine servicemen who had seen the Mirage being shot down by Argentine guns and had removed the dead pilot from the crashed aeroplane . Similarly , the junta 's press office in Buenos Aires informed that Lieutenant Antonio Jukic , who actually was killed in his Pucará on the ground at Goose Green , had perished in a gallant , single - handed Pucará attack on HMS Hermes , setting it on fire . This statement was illustrated with dramatic sketches . The men at Goose Green knew that Lieutenant Jukic had died on the ground there .

The Falkland Islands ( / ˈfɔːlklənd / ; Spanish : Islas Malvinas , pronounced ( ˈislas malˈβinas ) ) is an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf . The principal islands are about 300 miles ( 483 kilometres ) east of South America 's southern Patagonian coast , at a latitude of about 52 ° S . The archipelago , with an area of 4,700 square miles ( 12,000 square kilometres ) , comprises East Falkland , West Falkland and 776 smaller islands . As a British overseas territory , the ' Falklands ' has internal self - governance , and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for its defence and foreign affairs . The Falkland Islands ' capital is Stanley on East Falkland .   Controversy exists over the Falklands ' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans . At various times , the islands have had French , British , Spanish , and Argentine settlements . Britain reasserted its rule in 1833 , although Argentina maintains its claim to the islands . In April 1982 , Argentine forces temporarily occupied the islands . British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War . Most Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory , but its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom .   The population ( 2,932 inhabitants in 2012 ) primarily consists of native - born Falkland Islanders , the majority of British descent . Other ethnicities include French , Gibraltarian and Scandinavian . Immigration from the United Kingdom , the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena , and Chile has reversed a population decline . The predominant ( and official ) language is English . Under the British Nationality ( Falkland Islands ) Act 1983 , Falkland Islanders are British citizens .   The islands lie on the boundary of the subantarctic oceanic and tundra climate zones , and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching 2,300 feet ( 700 m ) . They are home to large bird populations , although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from introduced species . Major economic activities include fishing , tourism and sheep farming , with an emphasis on high - quality wool exports . Oil exploration , licensed by the Falkland Islands Government , remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina .

The name `` Falkland '' was applied to the channel by John Strong , captain of an English expedition which landed on the islands in 1690 . Strong named the strait in honour of Anthony Cary , 5th Viscount of Falkland , the Treasurer of the Navy who sponsored its journey . The Viscount 's title originates from the town of Falkland , Scotland -- the town 's name likely comes from a Gaelic term referring to an `` enclosure '' ( lann ) , but it could less plausibly be from the Anglo - Saxon term `` folkland '' ( land held by folk - right ) . The name `` Falklands '' was not applied to the islands until 1765 , when British captain John Byron of the Royal Navy , claimed them for King George III as `` Falkland 's Islands '' . The term `` Falklands '' is a standard abbreviation used to refer to the islands .   The Spanish name for the archipelago , Islas Malvinas , derives from the French Îles Malouines -- the name given to the islands by French explorer Louis - Antoine de Bougainville in 1764 . Bougainville , who founded the islands ' first settlement , named the area after the port of Saint - Malo ( the point of departure for his ships and colonists ) . The port , located in the Brittany region of western France , was in turn named after St. Malo ( or Maclou ) , the Christian evangelist who founded the city .   At the twentieth session of the United Nations General Assembly , the Fourth Committee determined that , in all languages other than Spanish , all UN documentation would designate the territory as Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) . In Spanish , the territory was designated as Islas Malvinas ( Falkland Islands ) . The nomenclature used by the United Nations for statistical processing purposes is Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) .   History  Main articles : History of the Falkland Islands and Timeline of the history of the Falkland Islands  Although Fuegians from Patagonia may have visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times , the islands were uninhabited at the time of their discovery by Europeans . Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century , but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic . The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong , who , en route to Peru 's and Chile 's littoral in 1690 , discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands ' water and game .   The Falklands remained uninhabited until the 1764 establishment of Port Louis on East Falkland by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville , and the 1766 foundation of Port Egmont on Saunders Island by British captain John MacBride . Whether or not the settlements were aware of each other 's existence is debated by historians . In 1766 , France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain , which renamed the French colony Puerto Soledad the following year . Problems began when Spain discovered and captured Port Egmont in 1770 . War was narrowly avoided by its restitution to Britain in 1771 .   Both the British and Spanish settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774 , when Britain 's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily withdraw from the islands , leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III . Spain 's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata became the only governmental presence in the territory . West Falkland was left abandoned , and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp . Amid the British invasions of the Río de la Plata during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe , the islands ' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806 ; Spain 's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811 , except for gauchos and fishermen who remained voluntarily .   Thereafter , the archipelago was visited only by fishing ships ; its political status was undisputed until 1820 , when Colonel David Jewett , an American privateer working for the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata , informed anchored ships about Buenos Aires ' 1816 claim to Spain 's territories in the South Atlantic . Since the islands had no permanent inhabitants , in 1823 Buenos Aires granted German - born merchant Luis Vernet permission to conduct fishing activities and exploit feral cattle in the archipelago . Vernet settled at the ruins of Puerto Soledad in 1826 , and accumulated resources on the islands until the venture was secure enough to bring settlers and form a permanent colony . Buenos Aires named Vernet military and civil commander of the islands in 1829 , and he attempted to regulate sealing to stop the activities of foreign whalers and sealers . Vernet 's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights led to a raid by the American warship USS Lexington in 1831 , when United States Navy commander Silas Duncan declared the dissolution of the island 's government .  Depiction of a Falklands settlement in 1849 ( painting by Royal Navy Admiral Edward Fanshawe )  Buenos Aires attempted to retain influence over the settlement by installing a garrison , but a mutiny in 1832 was followed the next year by the arrival of British forces who reasserted Britain 's rule . The Argentine Confederation ( headed by Buenos Aires Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas ) protested against Britain 's actions , and Argentine governments have continued since then to register official protests against Britain . The British troops departed after completing their mission , leaving the area without formal government . Vernet 's deputy , the Scotsman Matthew Brisbane , returned to the islands that year to restore the business , but his efforts ended after , amid unrest at Port Louis , gaucho Antonio Rivero led a group of dissatisfied individuals to murder Brisbane and the settlement 's senior leaders ; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order . In 1840 , the Falklands became a Crown colony , and Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community . Four years later , nearly everyone relocated to Port Jackson , considered a better location for government , and merchant Samuel Lafone began a venture to encourage British colonisation .   Stanley , as Port Jackson was soon renamed , officially became the seat of government in 1845 . Early in its history , Stanley had a negative reputation due to cargo - shipping losses ; only in emergencies would ships rounding Cape Horn stop at the port . Nevertheless , the Falklands ' geographic location proved ideal for ship repairs and the `` Wrecking Trade '' , the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes . Aside from this trade , commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due to the low - value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures . Economic growth began only after the Falkland Islands Company , which bought out Lafone 's failing enterprise in 1851 , successfully introduced Cheviot sheep for wool farming , spurring other farms to follow suit . The high cost of importing materials , combined with the shortage of labour and consequent high wages , meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive . After 1870 , it declined as the replacement of sail ships by steamships was accelerated by the low cost of coal in South America ; by 1914 , with the opening of the Panama Canal , the trade effectively ended . In 1881 , the Falkland Islands became financially independent of Britain . For more than a century , the Falkland Islands Company dominated the trade and employment of the archipelago ; in addition , it owned most housing in Stanley , which greatly benefited from the wool trade with the UK .  Naval confrontation during the 1914 Battle of the Falkland Islands ( painting by William Lionel Wyllie )  In the first half of the 20th century , the Falklands served an important role in Britain 's territorial claims to subantarctic islands and a section of Antarctica . The Falklands governed these territories as the Falkland Islands Dependencies starting in 1908 , and retained them until their dissolution in 1985 . The Falklands also played a minor role in the two world wars as a military base aiding control of the South Atlantic . In the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914 , a Royal Navy fleet defeated an Imperial German squadron . In the Second World War , following the December 1939 Battle of the River Plate , the battle - damaged HMS Exeter steamed to the Falklands for repairs . In 1942 , a battalion en route to India was redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison amid fears of a Japanese seizure of the archipelago . After the war ended , the Falklands economy was affected by declining wool prices and the political uncertainty resulting from the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina .   Simmering tensions between the UK and Argentina increased during the second half of the century , when Argentine President Juan Perón asserted sovereignty over the archipelago . The sovereignty dispute intensified during the 1960s , shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on decolonisation which Argentina interpreted as favourable to its position . In 1965 , the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2065 , calling for both states to conduct bilateral negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute . From 1966 until 1968 , the UK confidentially discussed with Argentina the transfer of the Falklands , assuming its judgement would be accepted by the islanders . An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971 and , consequently , Argentina built a temporary airfield at Stanley in 1972 . Nonetheless , Falklander dissent , as expressed by their strong lobby in the UK Parliament , and tensions between the UK and Argentina effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977 .   Concerned at the expense of maintaining the Falkland Islands in an era of budget cuts , the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early Thatcher government . Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981 , and the dispute escalated with passing time . In April 1982 , the disagreement became an armed conflict when Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic , briefly occupying them until a UK expeditionary force retook the territories in June . After the war , the United Kingdom expanded its military presence , building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the size of its garrison . The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types , including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines . Due to the large number of deminer casualties , initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983 .   Based on Lord Shackleton 's recommendations , the Falklands diversified from a sheep - based monoculture into an economy of tourism and , with the establishment of the Falklands Exclusive Economic Zone , fisheries . The road network was also made more extensive , and the construction of RAF Mount Pleasant allowed access to long haul flights . Oil exploration also began , with indications of possible commercially exploitable deposits in the Falklands basin . Landmine clearance work restarted in 2009 , in accordance with the UK 's obligations under the Ottawa Treaty , and Sapper Hill Corral was cleared of mines in 2012 , allowing access to an important historical landmark for the first time in 30 years . Argentina and the UK re-established diplomatic relations in 1990 ; relations have since deteriorated as neither has agreed on the terms of future sovereignty discussions . Disputes between the governments have led `` some analysts ( to ) predict a growing conflict of interest between Argentina and Great Britain ... because of the recent expansion of the fishing industry in the waters surrounding the Falklands '' .   Government  Main article : Politics of the Falkland Islands Government House in Stanley is the Governor 's official residence .  The Falkland Islands are a self - governing British Overseas Territory . Under the 2009 Constitution , the islands have full internal self - government ; the UK is responsible for foreign affairs , retaining the power `` to protect UK interests and to ensure the overall good governance of the territory '' . The Monarch of the United Kingdom is the head of state , and executive authority is exercised on the monarch 's behalf by the Governor , who in turn appoints the islands ' Chief Executive on the advice of members of the Legislative Assembly . Both the Governor and Chief Executive serve as the head of government . Governor Nigel Phillips was appointed in September 2017 and Chief Executive Barry Rowland was appointed in October 2016 . The UK minister responsible for the Falkland Islands since 2016 , Alan Duncan , administers British foreign policy regarding the islands .   The Governor acts on the advice of the islands ' Executive Council , composed of the Chief Executive , the Director of Finance and three elected members of the Legislative Assembly ( with the Governor as chairman ) . The Legislative Assembly , a unicameral legislature , consists of the Chief Executive , the Director of Finance and eight members ( five from Stanley and three from Camp ) elected to four - year terms by universal suffrage . All politicians in the Falkland Islands are independent ; no political parties exist on the islands . Since the 2013 general election , members of the Legislative Assembly have received a salary and are expected to work full - time and give up all previously held jobs or business interests .   Due to its link to the UK , the Falklands are part of the overseas countries and territories of the European Union . The islands ' judicial system , overseen by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , is largely based on English law , and the constitution binds the territory to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights . Residents have the right of appeal to the European Court of Human Rights and the Privy Council . Law enforcement is the responsibility of the Royal Falkland Islands Police ( RFIP ) , and military defence of the islands is provided by the United Kingdom . A British military garrison is stationed on the islands , and the Falkland Islands government funds an additional company - sized light infantry Falkland Islands Defence Force . The territorial waters of the Falklands extend to 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) from its coastal baselines , based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ; this border overlaps with the maritime boundary of Argentina .   Sovereignty dispute  Main article : Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute  The United Kingdom and Argentina both claim the Falkland Islands . The UK 's position is that the Falklanders have not indicated a desire for change , and that there are no pending issues to resolve concerning the islands . The UK bases its position on its continuous administration of the islands since 1833 ( except for 1982 ) and the islanders ' `` right to self - determination as set out in the UN Charter '' . Argentine policy maintains that Falkland Islanders do not have a right to self - determination , claiming that in 1833 the UK expelled Argentine authorities ( and settlers ) from the Falklands with a threat of `` greater force '' and , afterwards , barred Argentines from resettling the islands . Argentina posits that it acquired the Falklands from Spain when it achieved independence in 1816 , and that the UK illegally occupied them in 1833 .   In 2009 , British prime minister Gordon Brown had a meeting with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , and said that there would be no further talks over the sovereignty of the Falklands . In March 2013 , the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status , with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule . Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations ; consequently , it dismissed the Falkland Islands ' sovereignty referendum .   Geography  Main article : Geography of the Falkland Islands Map of the Falkland Islands  The Falkland Islands has a land area of 4,700 square miles ( 12,000 km ) and a coastline estimated at 800 miles ( 1,300 km ) . Two main islands , West Falkland and East Falkland , and about 776 smaller islands constitute the archipelago . The islands are predominantly mountainous and hilly , with the major exception being the depressed plains of Lafonia ( a peninsula forming the southern part of East Falkland ) . The Falklands consists of continental crust fragments resulting from the break - up of Gondwana and the opening of the South Atlantic that began 130 million years ago . The islands are located in the South Atlantic Ocean , on the Patagonian Shelf , about 300 miles ( 480 km ) east of Patagonia in southern Argentina .   The Falklands is situated approximately at latitude 51 ° 40 ′ -- 53 ° 00 ′ S and longitude 57 ° 40 ′ -- 62 ° 00 ′ W . The archipelago 's two main islands are separated by the Falkland Sound , and its deep coastal indentations form natural harbours . East Falkland houses Stanley ( the capital and largest settlement ) , the UK military base at RAF Mount Pleasant , and the archipelago 's highest point : Mount Usborne , at 2,313 feet ( 705 m ) . Outside of these significant settlements is the area colloquially known as `` Camp '' , which is derived from the Spanish term for countryside ( Campo ) .   The climate of the islands is cold , windy and humid maritime . Variability of daily weather is typical throughout the archipelago . Rainfall is common over half of the year , averaging 610 millimetres ( 24 in ) in Stanley , and sporadic light snowfall occurs nearly all year . The temperature has historically stayed between 21.1 and − 11.1 ° C ( 70.0 and 12.0 ° F ) in Stanley , with mean monthly temperatures varying from 9 ° C ( 48 ° F ) early in the year to − 1 ° C ( 30 ° F ) in July . Strong westerly winds and cloudy skies are common . Although numerous storms are recorded each month , conditions are normally calm .   Biodiversity  Main article : Wildlife of the Falkland Islands Colony of southern rockhopper penguins on Saunders Island  The Falkland Islands are a biogeographical part of the mild Antarctic zone , with strong connections to the flora and fauna of Patagonia in mainland South America . Land birds make up most of the Falklands ' avifauna ; 63 species breed on the islands , including 16 endemic species . There is also abundant arthropod diversity on the islands . The Falklands ' flora consists of 163 native vascular species . The islands ' only native terrestrial mammal , the warrah , was hunted to extinction by European settlers .   The islands are frequented by marine mammals , such as the southern elephant seal and the South American fur seal , and various types of cetaceans ; offshore islands house the rare striated caracara . The Falklands are also home to five different penguin species and a few of the largest albatross colonies on the planet . Endemic fish around the islands are primarily from the genus Galaxias . The Falklands are treeless and have a wind - resistant vegetation predominantly composed of a variety of dwarf shrubs .   Virtually the entire land area of the islands is used as pasture for sheep . Introduced species include reindeer , hares , rabbits , Patagonian foxes , brown rats and cats . The detrimental impact several of these species have caused to native flora and fauna has led authorities to attempt to contain , remove or exterminate invasive species such as foxes , rabbits and rats . Endemic land animals have been the most affected by introduced species . The extent of human impact on the Falklands is unclear , since there is little long - term data on habitat change .   Economy  Main article : Economy of the Falkland Islands Stanley is the financial centre of the Falkland Islands ' economy .  The economy of the Falkland Islands is ranked the 222nd largest out of 229 in the world by GDP ( PPP ) , but ranks 5th worldwide by GDP ( PPP ) per capita . The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in 2010 , and inflation was last calculated at 1.2 percent rate in 2003 . Based on 2010 data , the islands have a high Human Development Index of 0.874 and a moderate Gini coefficient for income inequality of 34.17 . The local currency is the Falkland Islands pound , which is pegged to the British pound sterling .   Economic development was advanced by ship resupplying and sheep farming for high - quality wool . The main sheep breeds in the Falkland Islands are Polwarth and Corriedale . During the 1980s , although synthetic fibres and ranch underinvestment hurt the sheep - farming sector , the government established a major revenue stream with the establishment of an exclusive economic zone and the sale of fishing licenses to `` anybody wishing to fish within this zone '' . Since the end of the Falklands War in 1982 , the islands ' economic activity has increasingly focused on oil field exploration and tourism .   The port city of Stanley has regained the islands ' economic focus , with an increase in population as workers migrate from Camp . Fear of dependence on fishing licences and threats from overfishing , illegal fishing and fish market price fluctuations have increased interest on oil drilling as an alternative source of revenue ; exploration efforts have yet to find `` exploitable reserves '' . Development projects in education and sports have been funded by the Falklands government , without aid from the United Kingdom .   The primary sector of the economy accounts for most of the Falkland Islands ' gross domestic product , with the fishing industry alone contributing between 50 % and 60 % of annual GDP ; agriculture also contributes significantly to GDP and employs about a tenth of the population . A little over a quarter of the workforce serves the Falkland Islands government , making it the archipelago 's largest employer . Tourism , part of the service economy , has been spurred by increased interest in Antarctic exploration and the creation of direct air links with the United Kingdom and South America . Tourists , mostly cruise ship passengers , are attracted by the archipelago 's wildlife and environment , as well as activities such as fishing and wreck diving ; the majority are based in accommodation found in Stanley . The islands ' major exports include wool , hides , venison , fish and squid ; its main imports include fuel , building materials and clothing .   Demographics  See also : Origins of Falkland Islanders The Christ Church Cathedral , the local parish church of the Anglican Communion . Most Falklanders identify themselves as Christian .  The Falkland Islands comprises a homogeneous society , with the majority of inhabitants having been descended from Scottish and Welsh immigrants who settled the territory in 1833 . The 2006 census listed some Falklands residents as descendants of French , Gibraltarians and Scandinavians . That census indicated that one - third of residents were born on the archipelago , with foreign - born residents assimilated into local culture . The legal term for the right of residence is `` belonging to the islands '' . The British Nationality Act of 1983 gave British citizenship to Falkland Islanders .   A significant population decline affected the archipelago in the twentieth century , with many young islanders moving overseas in search of education , a modern lifestyle , and better job opportunities , particularly to the British city of Southampton , which came to be nicknamed `` Stanley north '' . In recent years , the islands ' population decline has reduced , thanks to immigrants from the United Kingdom , Saint Helena , and Chile . In the 2012 census , a majority of residents listed their nationality as Falkland Islander ( 59 percent ) , followed by British ( 29 percent ) , Saint Helenian ( 9.8 percent ) , and Chilean ( 5.4 percent ) . A small number of Argentines also live on the islands .   The Falkland Islands has a low population density . According to the 2012 census , the average daily population of the Falklands was 2,932 , excluding military personnel serving in the archipelago and their dependents . A 2012 report counted 1,300 uniformed personnel and 50 British Ministry of Defence civil servants present in the Falklands . Stanley ( with 2,121 residents ) is the most - populous location on the archipelago , followed by Mount Pleasant ( 369 residents , primarily air - base contractors ) and Camp ( 351 residents ) . The islands ' age distribution is skewed towards working age ( 20 -- 60 ) . Males outnumber females ( 53 to 47 percent ) , and this discrepancy is most prominent in the 20 -- 60 age group .   In the 2012 census , most islanders identified themselves as Christian ( 66 percent ) , followed by those with no religious affiliation ( 32 percent ) . The remaining 2 percent identified as adherents of other faiths , including Bahá'í , Buddhism , and Islam .   Education in the Falkland Islands , which follows England 's system , is free and compulsory for residents aged between 5 and 16 years . Primary education is available at Stanley , RAF Mount Pleasant ( for children of service personnel ) and a number of rural settlements . Secondary education is only available in Stanley , which offers boarding facilities and 12 subjects to General Certificate of Secondary Education ( GCSE ) level . Students aged 16 or older may study at colleges in England for their GCE Advanced Level or vocational qualifications . The Falkland Islands government pays for older students to attend institutions of higher education , usually in the United Kingdom .   Culture  Main article : Culture of the Falkland Islands Gauchos from mainland South America , such as these two men having mate at Hope Place in East Falkland , influenced the local dialect  Falklands culture is based on the cultural traditions brought by its British settlers , and it has also been influenced by the cultures of Hispanic South America . Some terms and place names used by the islands ' former Gaucho inhabitants are still applied in local speech . The Falklands ' predominant and official language is English , with the foremost dialect being British English ; nonetheless , inhabitants also speak Spanish and other languages . According to naturalist Will Wagstaff , `` the Falkland Islands are a very social place , and stopping for a chat is a way of life '' .   The islands have two weekly newspapers : Teaberry Express and The Penguin News , and television and radio broadcasts generally feature programming from the United Kingdom . Wagstaff describes local cuisine as `` very British in character with much use made of the homegrown vegetables , local lamb , mutton , beef , and fish '' . Common between meals are `` home made cakes and biscuits with tea or coffee '' . Social activities are , according to Wagstaff , `` typical of that of a small British town with a variety of clubs and organisations covering many aspects of community life '' .

Jump up ^ According to researcher Simon Taylor , the exact Gaelic etymology is unclear as the `` falk '' in the name could have stood for `` hidden '' ( falach ) , `` wash '' ( failc ) , or `` heavy rain '' ( falc ) .   Jump up ^ Based on his analysis of Falkland Islands discovery claims , historian John Dunmore concludes that `` ( a ) number of countries could therefore lay some claim to the archipelago under the heading of first discoverers : Spain , Holland , Britain , and even Italy and Portugal -- although the last two claimants might be stretching things a little . ''   Jump up ^ In 1764 , Bougainville claimed the islands in the name of Louis XV of France . In 1765 , British captain John Byron claimed the islands in the name of George III of Great Britain .   Jump up ^ According to Argentine legal analyst Roberto Laver , the United Kingdom disregards Jewett 's actions because the government he represented `` was not recognized either by Britain or any other foreign power at the time '' and `` no act of occupation followed the ceremony of claiming possession '' .   Jump up ^ Before leaving for the Falklands Vernet stamped his grant at the British Consulate , repeating this when Buenos Aires extended his grant in 1828 . The cordial relationship between the consulate and Vernet led him to express `` the wish that , in the event of the British returning to the islands , HMG would take his settlement under their protection '' .   Jump up ^ The log of the `` Lexington '' only reports the destruction of arms and a powder store , but Vernet made a claim for compensation from the US Government stating that the entire settlement was destroyed .   Jump up ^ As discussed by Roberto Laver , not only did Rosas not break relations with Britain because of the `` essential '' nature of `` British economic support '' , but he offered the Falklands `` as a bargaining chip ... in exchange for the cancellation of Argentina 's million - pound debt with the British bank of Baring Brothers '' . In 1850 , Rosas ' government ratified the Arana -- Southern Treaty , which put `` an end to the existing differences , and of restoring perfect relations of friendship '' between the United Kingdom and Argentina .   Jump up ^ Argentina protested in 1841 , 1849 , 1884 , 1888 , 1908 , 1927 and 1933 , and has made annual protests to the United Nations since 1946 .   Jump up ^ There were continual tensions with the colonial administration over Lafone 's failure to establish any permanent settlers , and over the price of beef supplied to the settlement . Moreover , although his concession required Lafone to bring settlers from the United Kingdom , most of the settlers he brought were gauchos from Uruguay .   Jump up ^ The minefields were fenced off and marked ; there remain unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices . Detection and clearance of mines in the Falklands has proven difficult as some were air - delivered and not in marked fields ; approximately 80 % lie in sand or peat , where the position of mines can shift , making removal procedures difficult .   Jump up ^ In 1976 , Lord Shackleton produced a report into the economic future of the islands ; however , his recommendations were not implemented because Britain sought to avoid confronting Argentina over sovereignty . Lord Shackleton was once again tasked , in 1982 , to produce a report into the economic development of the islands . His new report criticised the large farming companies , and recommended transferring ownership of farms from absentee landlords to local landowners . Shackleton also suggested diversifying the economy into fishing , oil exploration , and tourism ; moreover , he recommended the establishment of a road network , and conservation measures to preserve the islands ' natural resources .   Jump up ^ Roberto Laver argues this is likely the result of government policies which successfully reduced the number of non-British populations that at one point also inhabited the archipelago . Laver states that `` naturalization ordinances '' in the first decades of the British colony `` show a wide variety of settlers from places in Europe , Northern , and Central America , and a couple from Argentina '' .

The Falkland Islands ( / ˈfɔːlklənd / ; Spanish : Islas Malvinas , pronounced ( ˈizlaz malˈβinas ) ) are an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf . The principal islands are about 300 miles ( 483 kilometres ) east of South America 's southern Patagonian coast , at a latitude of about 52 ° S . The archipelago , with an area of 4,700 square miles ( 12,000 square kilometres ) , comprises East Falkland , West Falkland and 776 smaller islands . As a British overseas territory , the Falklands have internal self - governance , and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs . The islands ' capital is Stanley on East Falkland .   Controversy exists over the Falklands ' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans . At various times , the islands have had French , British , Spanish , and Argentine settlements . Britain reasserted its rule in 1833 , although Argentina maintains its claim to the islands . In April 1982 , Argentine forces temporarily occupied the islands . British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War . Most Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory , but its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom .   The population ( 2,932 inhabitants in 2012 ) primarily consists of native - born Falkland Islanders , the majority of British descent . Other ethnicities include French , Gibraltarian and Scandinavian . Immigration from the United Kingdom , the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena , and Chile has reversed a population decline . The predominant ( and official ) language is English . Under the British Nationality ( Falkland Islands ) Act 1983 , Falkland Islanders are British citizens .   The islands lie on the boundary of the subantarctic oceanic and tundra climate zones , and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching 2,300 feet ( 700 m ) . They are home to large bird populations , although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from introduced species . Major economic activities include fishing , tourism and sheep farming , with an emphasis on high - quality wool exports . Oil exploration , licensed by the Falkland Islands Government , remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina .

The name `` Falkland '' was applied to the channel by John Strong , captain of an English expedition which landed on the islands in 1690 . Strong named the strait in honour of Anthony Cary , 5th Viscount of Falkland , the Treasurer of the Navy who sponsored their journey . The Viscount 's title originates from the town of Falkland , Scotland -- the town 's name likely comes from a Gaelic term referring to an `` enclosure '' ( lann ) , but it could less plausibly be from the Anglo - Saxon term `` folkland '' ( land held by folk - right ) . The name `` Falklands '' was not applied to the islands until 1765 , when British captain John Byron of the Royal Navy , claimed them for King George III as `` Falkland 's Islands '' . The term `` Falklands '' is a standard abbreviation used to refer to the islands .   The Spanish name for the archipelago , Islas Malvinas , derives from the French Îles Malouines -- the name given to the islands by French explorer Louis - Antoine de Bougainville in 1764 . Bougainville , who founded the islands ' first settlement , named the area after the port of Saint - Malo ( the point of departure for his ships and colonists ) . The port , located in the Brittany region of western France , was in turn named after St. Malo ( or Maclou ) , the Christian evangelist who founded the city .   At the twentieth session of the United Nations General Assembly , the Fourth Committee determined that , in all languages other than Spanish , all UN documentation would designate the territory as Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) . In Spanish , the territory was designated as Islas Malvinas ( Falkland Islands ) . The nomenclature used by the United Nations for statistical processing purposes is Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) .   History  Main articles : History of the Falkland Islands and Timeline of the history of the Falkland Islands  Although Fuegians from Patagonia may have visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times , the islands were uninhabited at the time of their discovery by Europeans . Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century , but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic . The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong , who , en route to Peru 's and Chile 's littoral in 1690 , discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands ' water and game .   The Falklands remained uninhabited until the 1764 establishment of Port Louis on East Falkland by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville , and the 1766 foundation of Port Egmont on Saunders Island by British captain John MacBride . Whether or not the settlements were aware of each other 's existence is debated by historians . In 1766 , France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain , which renamed the French colony Puerto Soledad the following year . Problems began when Spain discovered and captured Port Egmont in 1770 . War was narrowly avoided by its restitution to Britain in 1771 .   Both the British and Spanish settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774 , when Britain 's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily withdraw from the islands , leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III . Spain 's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata became the only governmental presence in the territory . West Falkland was left abandoned , and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp . Amid the British invasions of the Río de la Plata during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe , the islands ' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806 ; Spain 's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811 , except for gauchos and fishermen who remained voluntarily .   Thereafter , the archipelago was visited only by fishing ships ; its political status was undisputed until 1820 , when Colonel David Jewett , an American privateer working for the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata , informed anchored ships about Buenos Aires ' 1816 claim to Spain 's territories in the South Atlantic . Since the islands had no permanent inhabitants , in 1823 Buenos Aires granted German - born merchant Luis Vernet permission to conduct fishing activities and exploit feral cattle in the archipelago . Vernet settled at the ruins of Puerto Soledad in 1826 , and accumulated resources on the islands until the venture was secure enough to bring settlers and form a permanent colony . Buenos Aires named Vernet military and civil commander of the islands in 1829 , and he attempted to regulate sealing to stop the activities of foreign whalers and sealers . Vernet 's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights led to a raid by the American warship USS Lexington in 1831 , when United States Navy commander Silas Duncan declared the dissolution of the island 's government .  Depiction of a Falklands settlement in 1849 ( painting by Royal Navy Admiral Edward Fanshawe )  Buenos Aires attempted to retain influence over the settlement by installing a garrison , but a mutiny in 1832 was followed the next year by the arrival of British forces who reasserted Britain 's rule . The Argentine Confederation ( headed by Buenos Aires Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas ) protested against Britain 's actions , and Argentine governments have continued since then to register official protests against Britain . The British troops departed after completing their mission , leaving the area without formal government . Vernet 's deputy , the Scotsman Matthew Brisbane , returned to the islands that year to restore the business , but his efforts ended after , amid unrest at Port Louis , gaucho Antonio Rivero led a group of dissatisfied individuals to murder Brisbane and the settlement 's senior leaders ; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order . In 1840 , the Falklands became a Crown colony , and Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community . Four years later , nearly everyone relocated to Port Jackson , considered a better location for government , and merchant Samuel Lafone began a venture to encourage British colonisation .   Stanley , as Port Jackson was soon renamed , officially became the seat of government in 1845 . Early in its history , Stanley had a negative reputation due to cargo - shipping losses ; only in emergencies would ships rounding Cape Horn stop at the port . Nevertheless , the Falklands ' geographic location proved ideal for ship repairs and the `` Wrecking Trade '' , the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes . Aside from this trade , commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due to the low - value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures . Economic growth began only after the Falkland Islands Company , which bought out Lafone 's failing enterprise in 1851 , successfully introduced Cheviot sheep for wool farming , spurring other farms to follow suit . The high cost of importing materials , combined with the shortage of labour and consequent high wages , meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive . After 1870 , it declined as the replacement of sail ships by steamships was accelerated by the low cost of coal in South America ; by 1914 , with the opening of the Panama Canal , the trade effectively ended . In 1881 , the Falkland Islands became financially independent of Britain . For more than a century , the Falkland Islands Company dominated the trade and employment of the archipelago ; in addition , it owned most housing in Stanley , which greatly benefited from the wool trade with the UK .  Naval confrontation during the 1914 Battle of the Falkland Islands ( painting by William Lionel Wyllie )  In the first half of the 20th century , the Falklands served an important role in Britain 's territorial claims to subantarctic islands and a section of Antarctica . The Falklands governed these territories as the Falkland Islands Dependencies starting in 1908 , and retained them until their dissolution in 1985 . The Falklands also played a minor role in the two world wars as a military base aiding control of the South Atlantic . In the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914 , a Royal Navy fleet defeated an Imperial German squadron . In the Second World War , following the December 1939 Battle of the River Plate , the battle - damaged HMS Exeter steamed to the Falklands for repairs . In 1942 , a battalion en route to India was redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison amid fears of a Japanese seizure of the archipelago . After the war ended , the Falklands economy was affected by declining wool prices and the political uncertainty resulting from the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina .   Simmering tensions between the UK and Argentina increased during the second half of the century , when Argentine President Juan Perón asserted sovereignty over the archipelago . The sovereignty dispute intensified during the 1960s , shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on decolonisation which Argentina interpreted as favourable to its position . In 1965 , the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2065 , calling for both states to conduct bilateral negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute . From 1966 until 1968 , the UK confidentially discussed with Argentina the transfer of the Falklands , assuming its judgement would be accepted by the islanders . An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971 and , consequently , Argentina built a temporary airfield at Stanley in 1972 . Nonetheless , Falklander dissent , as expressed by their strong lobby in the UK Parliament , and tensions between the UK and Argentina effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977 .   Concerned at the expense of maintaining the Falkland Islands in an era of budget cuts , the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early Thatcher government . Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981 , and the dispute escalated with passing time . In April 1982 , the disagreement became an armed conflict when Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic , briefly occupying them until a UK expeditionary force retook the territories in June . After the war , the United Kingdom expanded its military presence , building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the size of its garrison . The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types , including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines . Due to the large number of deminer casualties , initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983 .   Based on Lord Shackleton 's recommendations , the Falklands diversified from a sheep - based monoculture into an economy of tourism and , with the establishment of the Falklands Exclusive Economic Zone , fisheries . The road network was also made more extensive , and the construction of RAF Mount Pleasant allowed access to long haul flights . Oil exploration also began , with indications of possible commercially exploitable deposits in the Falklands basin . Landmine clearance work restarted in 2009 , in accordance with the UK 's obligations under the Ottawa Treaty , and Sapper Hill Corral was cleared of mines in 2012 , allowing access to an important historical landmark for the first time in 30 years . Argentina and the UK re-established diplomatic relations in 1990 ; relations have since deteriorated as neither has agreed on the terms of future sovereignty discussions . Disputes between the governments have led `` some analysts ( to ) predict a growing conflict of interest between Argentina and Great Britain ... because of the recent expansion of the fishing industry in the waters surrounding the Falklands '' .   Government  Main article : Politics of the Falkland Islands Government House in Stanley is the Governor 's official residence .  The Falkland Islands are a self - governing British Overseas Territory . Under the 2009 Constitution , the islands have full internal self - government ; the UK is responsible for foreign affairs , retaining the power `` to protect UK interests and to ensure the overall good governance of the territory '' . The Monarch of the United Kingdom is the head of state , and executive authority is exercised on the monarch 's behalf by the Governor , who in turn appoints the islands ' Chief Executive on the advice of members of the Legislative Assembly . Both the Governor and Chief Executive serve as the head of government . Governor Nigel Phillips was appointed in September 2017 and Chief Executive Barry Rowland was appointed in October 2016 . The UK minister responsible for the Falkland Islands since 2016 , Alan Duncan , administers British foreign policy regarding the islands .   The Governor acts on the advice of the islands ' Executive Council , composed of the Chief Executive , the Director of Finance and three elected members of the Legislative Assembly ( with the Governor as chairman ) . The Legislative Assembly , a unicameral legislature , consists of the Chief Executive , the Director of Finance and eight members ( five from Stanley and three from Camp ) elected to four - year terms by universal suffrage . All politicians in the Falkland Islands are independent ; no political parties exist on the islands . Since the 2013 general election , members of the Legislative Assembly have received a salary and are expected to work full - time and give up all previously held jobs or business interests .   Due to its link to the UK , the Falklands are part of the overseas countries and territories of the European Union . The islands ' judicial system , overseen by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , is largely based on English law , and the constitution binds the territory to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights . Residents have the right of appeal to the European Court of Human Rights and the Privy Council . Law enforcement is the responsibility of the Royal Falkland Islands Police ( RFIP ) , and military defence of the islands is provided by the United Kingdom . A British military garrison is stationed on the islands , and the Falkland Islands government funds an additional company - sized light infantry Falkland Islands Defence Force . The territorial waters of the Falklands extend to 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) from its coastal baselines , based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ; this border overlaps with the maritime boundary of Argentina .   Sovereignty dispute  Main article : Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute  The United Kingdom and Argentina both claim the Falkland Islands . The UK 's position is that the Falklanders have not indicated a desire for change , and that there are no pending issues to resolve concerning the islands . The UK bases its position on its continuous administration of the islands since 1833 ( except for 1982 ) and the islanders ' `` right to self - determination as set out in the UN Charter '' . Argentine policy maintains that Falkland Islanders do not have a right to self - determination , claiming that in 1833 the UK expelled Argentine authorities ( and settlers ) from the Falklands with a threat of `` greater force '' and , afterwards , barred Argentines from resettling the islands . Argentina posits that it acquired the Falklands from Spain when it achieved independence in 1816 , and that the UK illegally occupied them in 1833 .   In 2009 , British prime minister Gordon Brown had a meeting with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , and said that there would be no further talks over the sovereignty of the Falklands . In March 2013 , the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status , with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule . Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations ; consequently , it dismissed the Falkland Islands ' sovereignty referendum .   Geography  Main article : Geography of the Falkland Islands Map of the Falkland Islands  The Falkland Islands have a land area of 4,700 square miles ( 12,000 km ) and a coastline estimated at 800 miles ( 1,300 km ) . Two main islands , West Falkland and East Falkland , and about 776 smaller islands constitute the archipelago . The islands are predominantly mountainous and hilly , with the major exception the depressed plains of Lafonia ( a peninsula forming the southern part of East Falkland ) . The Falklands are continental crust fragments resulting from the break - up of Gondwana and the opening of the South Atlantic that began 130 million years ago . The islands are located in the South Atlantic Ocean , on the Patagonian Shelf , about 300 miles ( 480 km ) east of Patagonia in southern Argentina .   The Falklands are situated approximately at latitude 51 ° 40 ′ -- 53 ° 00 ′ S and longitude 57 ° 40 ′ -- 62 ° 00 ′ W . The archipelago 's two main islands are separated by the Falkland Sound , and its deep coastal indentations form natural harbours . East Falkland houses Stanley ( the capital and largest settlement ) , the UK military base at RAF Mount Pleasant , and the archipelago 's highest point : Mount Usborne , at 2,313 feet ( 705 m ) . Outside of these significant settlements is the area colloquially known as `` Camp '' , which is derived from the Spanish term for countryside ( Campo ) .   The climate of the islands is cold , windy and humid maritime . Variability of daily weather is typical throughout the archipelago . Rainfall is common over half of the year , averaging 610 millimetres ( 24 in ) in Stanley , and sporadic light snowfall occurs nearly all year . The temperature has historically stayed between 21.1 and − 11.1 ° C ( 70.0 and 12.0 ° F ) in Stanley , with mean monthly temperatures varying from 9 ° C ( 48 ° F ) early in the year to − 1 ° C ( 30 ° F ) in July . Strong westerly winds and cloudy skies are common . Although numerous storms are recorded each month , conditions are normally calm .   Biodiversity  Main article : Wildlife of the Falkland Islands Colony of southern rockhopper penguins on Saunders Island  The Falkland Islands are a biogeographical part of the mild Antarctic zone , with strong connections to the flora and fauna of Patagonia in mainland South America . Land birds make up most of the Falklands ' avifauna ; 63 species breed on the islands , including 16 endemic species . There is also abundant arthropod diversity on the islands . The Falklands ' flora consists of 163 native vascular species . The islands ' only native terrestrial mammal , the warrah , was hunted to extinction by European settlers .   The islands are frequented by marine mammals , such as the southern elephant seal and the South American fur seal , and various types of cetaceans ; offshore islands house the rare striated caracara . The Falklands are also home to five different penguin species and a few of the largest albatross colonies on the planet . Endemic fish around the islands are primarily from the genus Galaxias . The Falklands are treeless and have a wind - resistant vegetation predominantly composed of a variety of dwarf shrubs .   Virtually the entire land area of the islands is used as pasture for sheep . Introduced species include reindeer , hares , rabbits , Patagonian foxes , brown rats and cats . The detrimental impact several of these species have caused to native flora and fauna has led authorities to attempt to contain , remove or exterminate invasive species such as foxes , rabbits and rats . Endemic land animals have been the most affected by introduced species . The extent of human impact on the Falklands is unclear , since there is little long - term data on habitat change .   Economy  Main article : Economy of the Falkland Islands Stanley is the financial centre of the Falkland Islands ' economy .  The economy of the Falkland Islands is ranked the 222nd largest out of 229 in the world by GDP ( PPP ) , but ranks 5th worldwide by GDP ( PPP ) per capita . The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in 2010 , and inflation was last calculated at 1.2 percent rate in 2003 . Based on 2010 data , the islands have a high Human Development Index of 0.874 and a moderate Gini coefficient for income inequality of 34.17 . The local currency is the Falkland Islands pound , which is pegged to the British pound sterling .   Economic development was advanced by ship resupplying and sheep farming for high - quality wool . The main sheep breeds in the Falkland Islands are Polwarth and Corriedale . During the 1980s , although synthetic fibres and ranch underinvestment hurt the sheep - farming sector , the government established a major revenue stream with the establishment of an exclusive economic zone and the sale of fishing licenses to `` anybody wishing to fish within this zone '' . Since the end of the Falklands War in 1982 , the islands ' economic activity has increasingly focused on oil field exploration and tourism .   The port city of Stanley has regained the islands ' economic focus , with an increase in population as workers migrate from Camp . Fear of dependence on fishing licences and threats from overfishing , illegal fishing and fish market price fluctuations have increased interest on oil drilling as an alternative source of revenue ; exploration efforts have yet to find `` exploitable reserves '' . Development projects in education and sports have been funded by the Falklands government , without aid from the United Kingdom .   The primary sector of the economy accounts for most of the Falkland Islands ' gross domestic product , with the fishing industry alone contributing between 50 % and 60 % of annual GDP ; agriculture also contributes significantly to GDP and employs about a tenth of the population . A little over a quarter of the workforce serves the Falkland Islands government , making it the archipelago 's largest employer . Tourism , part of the service economy , has been spurred by increased interest in Antarctic exploration and the creation of direct air links with the United Kingdom and South America . Tourists , mostly cruise ship passengers , are attracted by the archipelago 's wildlife and environment , as well as activities such as fishing and wreck diving ; the majority are based in accommodation found in Stanley . The islands ' major exports include wool , hides , venison , fish and squid ; its main imports include fuel , building materials and clothing .   Demographics  See also : Origins of Falkland Islanders The Christ Church Cathedral , the local parish church of the Anglican Communion . Most Falklanders identify themselves as Christian .  The Falkland Islands are a homogeneous society , with the majority of inhabitants descended from Scottish and Welsh immigrants who settled the territory in 1833 . The 2006 census listed some Falklands residents as descendants of French , Gibraltarians and Scandinavians . That census indicated that one - third of residents were born on the archipelago , with foreign - born residents assimilated into local culture . The legal term for the right of residence is `` belonging to the islands '' . The British Nationality Act of 1983 gave British citizenship to Falkland Islanders .   A significant population decline affected the archipelago in the twentieth century , with many young islanders moving overseas in search of education , a modern lifestyle , and better job opportunities , particularly to the British city of Southampton , which came to be nicknamed `` Stanley north '' . In recent years , the island 's population decline has steadied , thanks to immigrants from the United Kingdom , Saint Helena , and Chile . In the 2012 census , a majority of residents listed their nationality as Falkland Islander ( 59 percent ) , followed by British ( 29 percent ) , Saint Helenian ( 9.8 percent ) , and Chilean ( 5.4 percent ) . A small number of Argentines also live on the islands .   The Falkland Islands have a low population density . According to the 2012 census , the average daily population of the Falklands was 2,932 , excluding military personnel serving in the archipelago and their dependents . A 2012 report counted 1,300 uniformed personnel and 50 British Ministry of Defence civil servants present in the Falklands . Stanley ( with 2,121 residents ) is the most - populous location on the archipelago , followed by Mount Pleasant ( 369 residents , primarily air - base contractors ) and Camp ( 351 residents ) . The islands ' age distribution is skewed towards working age ( 20 -- 60 ) . Males outnumber females ( 53 to 47 percent ) , and this discrepancy is most prominent in the 20 -- 60 age group .   In the 2012 census most islanders identified themselves as Christian ( 66 percent ) , followed by those who had no religious affiliation ( 32 percent ) . The remaining 2 percent were adherents of other faiths . Christianity is diverse , with Anglicans , Presbyterians , Roman Catholics , Jehovah 's Witnesses , Lutherans and Seventh - day Adventists having the most adherents . Among other religions , the Bahá'í Faith has a strong local following .   Education in the Falkland Islands , which follows England 's system , is free and compulsory for residents aged between 5 and 16 years . Primary education is available at Stanley , RAF Mount Pleasant ( for children of service personnel ) and a number of rural settlements . Secondary education is only available in Stanley , which offers boarding facilities and 12 subjects to General Certificate of Secondary Education ( GCSE ) level . Students aged 16 or older may study at colleges in England for their GCE Advanced Level or vocational qualifications . The Falkland Islands government pays for older students to attend institutions of higher education , usually in the United Kingdom .   Culture  Main article : Culture of the Falkland Islands Gauchos from mainland South America , such as these two men having mate at Hope Place in East Falkland , influenced the local dialect  Falklands culture is based on the cultural traditions brought by its British settlers , and it has also been influenced by the cultures of Hispanic South America . Some terms and place names used by the islands ' former Gaucho inhabitants are still applied in local speech . The Falklands ' predominant and official language is English , with the foremost dialect being British English ; nonetheless , inhabitants also speak Spanish and other languages . According to naturalist Will Wagstaff , `` the Falkland Islands are a very social place , and stopping for a chat is a way of life '' .   The islands have two weekly newspapers : Teaberry Express and The Penguin News , and television and radio broadcasts generally feature programming from the United Kingdom . Wagstaff describes local cuisine as `` very British in character with much use made of the homegrown vegetables , local lamb , mutton , beef , and fish '' . Common between meals are `` home made cakes and biscuits with tea or coffee '' . Social activities are , according to Wagstaff , `` typical of that of a small British town with a variety of clubs and organisations covering many aspects of community life '' .

Jump up ^ According to researcher Simon Taylor , the exact Gaelic etymology is unclear as the `` falk '' in the name could have stood for `` hidden '' ( falach ) , `` wash '' ( failc ) , or `` heavy rain '' ( falc ) .   Jump up ^ Based on his analysis of Falkland Islands discovery claims , historian John Dunmore concludes that `` ( a ) number of countries could therefore lay some claim to the archipelago under the heading of first discoverers : Spain , Holland , Britain , and even Italy and Portugal -- although the last two claimants might be stretching things a little . ''   Jump up ^ In 1764 , Bougainville claimed the islands in the name of Louis XV of France . In 1765 , British captain John Byron claimed the islands in the name of George III of Great Britain .   Jump up ^ According to Argentine legal analyst Roberto Laver , the United Kingdom disregards Jewett 's actions because the government he represented `` was not recognized either by Britain or any other foreign power at the time '' and `` no act of occupation followed the ceremony of claiming possession '' .   Jump up ^ Before leaving for the Falklands Vernet stamped his grant at the British Consulate , repeating this when Buenos Aires extended his grant in 1828 . The cordial relationship between the consulate and Vernet led him to express `` the wish that , in the event of the British returning to the islands , HMG would take his settlement under their protection '' .   Jump up ^ The log of the `` Lexington '' only reports the destruction of arms and a powder store , but Vernet made a claim for compensation from the US Government stating that the entire settlement was destroyed .   Jump up ^ As discussed by Roberto Laver , not only did Rosas not break relations with Britain because of the `` essential '' nature of `` British economic support '' , but he offered the Falklands `` as a bargaining chip ... in exchange for the cancellation of Argentina 's million - pound debt with the British bank of Baring Brothers '' . In 1850 , Rosas ' government ratified the Arana -- Southern Treaty , which put `` an end to the existing differences , and of restoring perfect relations of friendship '' between the United Kingdom and Argentina .   Jump up ^ Argentina protested in 1841 , 1849 , 1884 , 1888 , 1908 , 1927 and 1933 , and has made annual protests to the United Nations since 1946 .   Jump up ^ There were continual tensions with the colonial administration over Lafone 's failure to establish any permanent settlers , and over the price of beef supplied to the settlement . Moreover , although his concession required Lafone to bring settlers from the United Kingdom , most of the settlers he brought were gauchos from Uruguay .   Jump up ^ The minefields were fenced off and marked ; there remain unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices . Detection and clearance of mines in the Falklands has proven difficult as some were air - delivered and not in marked fields ; approximately 80 % lie in sand or peat , where the position of mines can shift , making removal procedures difficult .   Jump up ^ In 1976 , Lord Shackleton produced a report into the economic future of the islands ; however , his recommendations were not implemented because Britain sought to avoid confronting Argentina over sovereignty . Lord Shackleton was once again tasked , in 1982 , to produce a report into the economic development of the islands . His new report criticised the large farming companies , and recommended transferring ownership of farms from absentee landlords to local landowners . Shackleton also suggested diversifying the economy into fishing , oil exploration , and tourism ; moreover , he recommended the establishment of a road network , and conservation measures to preserve the islands ' natural resources .   Jump up ^ Roberto Laver argues this is likely the result of government policies which successfully reduced the number of non-British populations that at one point also inhabited the archipelago . Laver states that `` naturalization ordinances '' in the first decades of the British colony `` show a wide variety of settlers from places in Europe , Northern , and Central America , and a couple from Argentina '' .

The Falkland Islands ( / ˈfɔːlklənd / ; Spanish : Islas Malvinas , pronounced ( ˈislas malˈβinas ) ) is an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf . The principal islands are about 300 miles ( 483 kilometres ) east of South America 's southern Patagonian coast , at a latitude of about 52 ° S . The archipelago , with an area of 4,700 square miles ( 12,000 square kilometres ) , comprises East Falkland , West Falkland and 776 smaller islands . As a British overseas territory , the Falklands have internal self - governance , and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs . The Falkland Islands ' capital is Stanley on East Falkland .   Controversy exists over the Falklands ' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans . At various times , the islands have had French , British , Spanish , and Argentine settlements . Britain reasserted its rule in 1833 , although Argentina maintains its claim to the islands . In April 1982 , Argentine forces temporarily occupied the islands . British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War . Most Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory , but its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom .   The population ( 2,932 inhabitants in 2012 ) primarily consists of native - born Falkland Islanders , the majority of British descent . Other ethnicities include French , Gibraltarian and Scandinavian . Immigration from the United Kingdom , the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena , and Chile has reversed a population decline . The predominant ( and official ) language is English . Under the British Nationality ( Falkland Islands ) Act 1983 , Falkland Islanders are British citizens .   The islands lie on the boundary of the subantarctic oceanic and tundra climate zones , and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching 2,300 feet ( 700 m ) . They are home to large bird populations , although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from introduced species . Major economic activities include fishing , tourism and sheep farming , with an emphasis on high - quality wool exports . Oil exploration , licensed by the Falkland Islands Government , remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina .

The name `` Falkland '' was applied to the channel by John Strong , captain of an English expedition which landed on the islands in 1690 . Strong named the strait in honour of Anthony Cary , 5th Viscount of Falkland , the Treasurer of the Navy who sponsored his journey . The Viscount 's title originates from the town of Falkland , Scotland -- the town 's name likely comes from a Gaelic term referring to an `` enclosure '' ( lann ) , but it could less plausibly be from the Anglo - Saxon term `` folkland '' ( land held by folk - right ) . The name `` Falklands '' was not applied to the islands until 1765 , when British captain John Byron of the Royal Navy , claimed them for King George III as `` Falkland 's Islands '' . The term `` Falklands '' is a standard abbreviation used to refer to the islands .   The Spanish name for the archipelago , Islas Malvinas , derives from the French Îles Malouines -- the name given to the islands by French explorer Louis - Antoine de Bougainville in 1764 . Bougainville , who founded the islands ' first settlement , named the area after the port of Saint - Malo ( the point of departure for his ships and colonists ) . The port , located in the Brittany region of western France , was in turn named after St. Malo ( or Maclou ) , the Christian evangelist who founded the city .   At the twentieth session of the United Nations General Assembly , the Fourth Committee determined that , in all languages other than Spanish , all UN documentation would designate the territory as Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) . In Spanish , the territory was designated as Islas Malvinas ( Falkland Islands ) . The nomenclature used by the United Nations for statistical processing purposes is Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) .   History  Main articles : History of the Falkland Islands and Timeline of the history of the Falkland Islands  Although Fuegians from Patagonia may have visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times , the islands were uninhabited when Europeans first discovered them . Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century , but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic . The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong , who , en route to Peru 's and Chile 's littoral in 1690 , discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands ' water and game .   The Falklands remained uninhabited until the 1764 establishment of Port Louis on East Falkland by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville , and the 1766 foundation of Port Egmont on Saunders Island by British captain John MacBride . Whether or not the settlements were aware of each other 's existence is debated by historians . In 1766 , France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain , which renamed the French colony Puerto Soledad the following year . Problems began when Spain discovered and captured Port Egmont in 1770 . War was narrowly avoided by its restitution to Britain in 1771 .   Both the British and Spanish settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774 , when Britain 's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily withdraw from the islands , leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III . Spain 's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata became the only governmental presence in the territory . West Falkland was left abandoned , and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp . Amid the British invasions of the Río de la Plata during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe , the islands ' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806 ; Spain 's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811 , except for gauchos and fishermen who remained voluntarily .   Thereafter , the archipelago was visited only by fishing ships ; its political status was undisputed until 1820 , when Colonel David Jewett , an American privateer working for the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata , informed anchored ships about Buenos Aires ' 1816 claim to Spain 's territories in the South Atlantic . Since the islands had no permanent inhabitants , in 1823 Buenos Aires granted German - born merchant Luis Vernet permission to conduct fishing activities and exploit feral cattle in the archipelago . Vernet settled at the ruins of Puerto Soledad in 1826 , and accumulated resources on the islands until the venture was secure enough to bring settlers and form a permanent colony . Buenos Aires named Vernet military and civil commander of the islands in 1829 , and he attempted to regulate sealing to stop the activities of foreign whalers and sealers . Vernet 's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights led to a raid by the American warship USS Lexington in 1831 , when United States Navy commander Silas Duncan declared the dissolution of the island 's government .  Depiction of a Falklands corral , shepherds and sheep in 1849 ( painting by Royal Navy Admiral Edward Fanshawe )  Buenos Aires attempted to retain influence over the settlement by installing a garrison , but a mutiny in 1832 was followed the next year by the arrival of British forces who reasserted Britain 's rule . The Argentine Confederation ( headed by Buenos Aires Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas ) protested against Britain 's actions , and Argentine governments have continued since then to register official protests against Britain . The British troops departed after completing their mission , leaving the area without formal government . Vernet 's deputy , the Scotsman Matthew Brisbane , returned to the islands that year to restore the business , but his efforts ended after , amid unrest at Port Louis , gaucho Antonio Rivero led a group of dissatisfied individuals to murder Brisbane and the settlement 's senior leaders ; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order . In 1840 , the Falklands became a Crown colony , and Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community . Four years later , nearly everyone relocated to Port Jackson , considered a better location for government , and merchant Samuel Lafone began a venture to encourage British colonisation .   Stanley , as Port Jackson was soon renamed , officially became the seat of government in 1845 . Early in its history , Stanley had a negative reputation due to cargo - shipping losses ; only in emergencies would ships rounding Cape Horn stop at the port . Nevertheless , the Falklands ' geographic location proved ideal for ship repairs and the `` Wrecking Trade '' , the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes . Aside from this trade , commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due to the low - value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures . Economic growth began only after the Falkland Islands Company , which bought out Lafone 's failing enterprise in 1851 , successfully introduced Cheviot sheep for wool farming , spurring other farms to follow suit . The high cost of importing materials , combined with the shortage of labour and consequent high wages , meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive . After 1870 , it declined as the replacement of sail ships by steamships was accelerated by the low cost of coal in South America ; by 1914 , with the opening of the Panama Canal , the trade effectively ended . In 1881 , the Falkland Islands became financially independent of Britain . For more than a century , the Falkland Islands Company dominated the trade and employment of the archipelago ; in addition , it owned most housing in Stanley , which greatly benefited from the wool trade with the UK .  Naval confrontation during the 1914 Battle of the Falkland Islands ( painting by William Lionel Wyllie )  In the first half of the 20th century , the Falklands served an important role in Britain 's territorial claims to subantarctic islands and a section of Antarctica . The Falklands governed these territories as the Falkland Islands Dependencies starting in 1908 , and retained them until their dissolution in 1985 . The Falklands also played a minor role in the two world wars as a military base aiding control of the South Atlantic . In the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914 , a Royal Navy fleet defeated an Imperial German squadron . In the Second World War , following the December 1939 Battle of the River Plate , the battle - damaged HMS Exeter steamed to the Falklands for repairs . In 1942 , a battalion en route to India was redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison amid fears of a Japanese seizure of the archipelago . After the war ended , the Falklands economy was affected by declining wool prices and the political uncertainty resulting from the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina .   Simmering tensions between the UK and Argentina increased during the second half of the century , when Argentine President Juan Perón asserted sovereignty over the archipelago . The sovereignty dispute intensified during the 1960s , shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on decolonisation which Argentina interpreted as favourable to its position . In 1965 , the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2065 , calling for both states to conduct bilateral negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute . From 1966 until 1968 , the UK confidentially discussed with Argentina the transfer of the Falklands , assuming its judgement would be accepted by the islanders . An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971 and , consequently , Argentina built a temporary airfield at Stanley in 1972 . Nonetheless , Falklander dissent , as expressed by their strong lobby in the UK Parliament , and tensions between the UK and Argentina effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977 .   Concerned at the expense of maintaining the Falkland Islands in an era of budget cuts , the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early Thatcher government . Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981 , and the dispute escalated with passing time . In April 1982 , the disagreement became an armed conflict when Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic , briefly occupying them until a UK expeditionary force retook the territories in June . After the war , the United Kingdom expanded its military presence , building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the size of its garrison . The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types , including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines . Due to the large number of deminer casualties , initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983 .   Based on Lord Shackleton 's recommendations , the Falklands diversified from a sheep - based monoculture into an economy of tourism and , with the establishment of the Falklands Exclusive Economic Zone , fisheries . The road network was also made more extensive , and the construction of RAF Mount Pleasant allowed access to long haul flights . Oil exploration also began , with indications of possible commercially exploitable deposits in the Falklands basin . Landmine clearance work restarted in 2009 , in accordance with the UK 's obligations under the Ottawa Treaty , and Sapper Hill Corral was cleared of mines in 2012 , allowing access to an important historical landmark for the first time in 30 years . Argentina and the UK re-established diplomatic relations in 1990 ; relations have since deteriorated as neither has agreed on the terms of future sovereignty discussions . Disputes between the governments have led `` some analysts ( to ) predict a growing conflict of interest between Argentina and Great Britain ... because of the recent expansion of the fishing industry in the waters surrounding the Falklands '' .   Government  Main article : Politics of the Falkland Islands Government House in Stanley is the Governor 's official residence .  The Falkland Islands are a self - governing British Overseas Territory . Under the 2009 Constitution , the islands have full internal self - government ; the UK is responsible for foreign affairs , retaining the power `` to protect UK interests and to ensure the overall good governance of the territory '' . The Monarch of the United Kingdom is the head of state , and executive authority is exercised on the monarch 's behalf by the Governor , who in turn appoints the islands ' Chief Executive on the advice of members of the Legislative Assembly . Both the Governor and Chief Executive serve as the head of government . Governor Nigel Phillips was appointed in September 2017 and Chief Executive Barry Rowland was appointed in October 2016 . The UK minister responsible for the Falkland Islands since 2016 , Alan Duncan , administers British foreign policy regarding the islands .   The Governor acts on the advice of the islands ' Executive Council , composed of the Chief Executive , the Director of Finance and three elected members of the Legislative Assembly ( with the Governor as chairman ) . The Legislative Assembly , a unicameral legislature , consists of the Chief Executive , the Director of Finance and eight members ( five from Stanley and three from Camp ) elected to four - year terms by universal suffrage . All politicians in the Falkland Islands are independent ; no political parties exist on the islands . Since the 2013 general election , members of the Legislative Assembly have received a salary and are expected to work full - time and give up all previously held jobs or business interests .   Due to its link to the UK , the Falklands are part of the overseas countries and territories of the European Union . The islands ' judicial system , overseen by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , is largely based on English law , and the constitution binds the territory to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights . Residents have the right of appeal to the European Court of Human Rights and the Privy Council . Law enforcement is the responsibility of the Royal Falkland Islands Police ( RFIP ) , and military defence of the islands is provided by the United Kingdom . A British military garrison is stationed on the islands , and the Falkland Islands government funds an additional company - sized light infantry Falkland Islands Defence Force . The territorial waters of the Falklands extend to 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) from its coastal baselines , based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ; this border overlaps with the maritime boundary of Argentina .   Sovereignty dispute  Main article : Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute  The United Kingdom and Argentina both claim the Falkland Islands . The UK bases its position on its continuous administration of the islands since 1833 and the islanders ' `` right to self - determination as set out in the UN Charter '' . Argentina 's position is that it acquired the Falklands from Spain when it achieved independence in 1816 , and that , in 1833 , the UK expelled Argentine authorities and settlers from the islands with a threat of `` greater force '' and , afterwards , barred Argentines from resettling the islands .   In 2009 , the British prime minister , Gordon Brown , had a meeting with the Argentine president , Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , and said that there would be no further talks over the sovereignty of the Falklands . In March 2013 , the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status , with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule . Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islanders as a partner in negotiations .   Geography  Main article : Geography of the Falkland Islands Map of the Falkland Islands  The Falkland Islands have a land area of 4,700 square miles ( 12,000 km ) and a coastline estimated at 800 miles ( 1,300 km ) . The archipelago consists of two main islands , West Falkland and East Falkland , and about 776 smaller islands . The islands are predominantly mountainous and hilly , with the major exception being the depressed plains of Lafonia ( a peninsula forming the southern part of East Falkland ) . The Falklands consists of continental crust fragments resulting from the break - up of Gondwana and the opening of the South Atlantic that began 130 million years ago . The islands are located in the South Atlantic Ocean , on the Patagonian Shelf , about 300 miles ( 480 km ) east of Patagonia in southern Argentina .   The Falklands ' approximate location is latitude 51 ° 40 ′ -- 53 ° 00 ′ S and longitude 57 ° 40 ′ -- 62 ° 00 ′ W . The archipelago 's two main islands are separated by the Falkland Sound , and its deep coastal indentations form natural harbours . East Falkland houses Stanley ( the capital and largest settlement ) , the UK military base at RAF Mount Pleasant , and the archipelago 's highest point : Mount Usborne , at 2,313 feet ( 705 m ) . Outside of these significant settlements is the area colloquially known as `` Camp '' , which is derived from the Spanish term for countryside ( Campo ) .   The climate of the islands is cold , windy and humid maritime . Variability of daily weather is typical throughout the archipelago . Rainfall is common over half of the year , averaging 610 millimetres ( 24 in ) in Stanley , and sporadic light snowfall occurs nearly all year . The temperature has historically stayed between 21.1 and − 11.1 ° C ( 70.0 and 12.0 ° F ) in Stanley , with mean monthly temperatures varying from 9 ° C ( 48 ° F ) early in the year to − 1 ° C ( 30 ° F ) in July . Strong westerly winds and cloudy skies are common . Although numerous storms are recorded each month , conditions are normally calm .   Biodiversity  Main article : Wildlife of the Falkland Islands Colony of southern rockhopper penguins on Saunders Island  The Falkland Islands are a biogeographical part of the mild Antarctic zone , with strong connections to the flora and fauna of Patagonia in mainland South America . Land birds make up most of the Falklands ' avifauna ; 63 species breed on the islands , including 16 endemic species . There is also abundant arthropod diversity on the islands . The Falklands ' flora consists of 163 native vascular species . The islands ' only native terrestrial mammal , the warrah , was hunted to extinction by European settlers .   The islands are frequented by marine mammals , such as the southern elephant seal and the South American fur seal , and various types of cetaceans ; offshore islands house the rare striated caracara . The Falklands are also home to five different penguin species and a few of the largest albatross colonies on the planet . Endemic fish around the islands are primarily from the genus Galaxias . The Falklands are treeless and have a wind - resistant vegetation predominantly composed of a variety of dwarf shrubs .   Virtually the entire land area of the islands is used as pasture for sheep . Introduced species include reindeer , hares , rabbits , Patagonian foxes , brown rats and cats . The detrimental impact several of these species have caused to native flora and fauna has led authorities to attempt to contain , remove or exterminate invasive species such as foxes , rabbits and rats . Endemic land animals have been the most affected by introduced species . The extent of human impact on the Falklands is unclear , since there is little long - term data on habitat change .   Economy  Main article : Economy of the Falkland Islands Stanley is the financial centre of the Falkland Islands ' economy .  The economy of the Falkland Islands is ranked the 222nd largest out of 229 in the world by GDP ( PPP ) , but ranks 5th worldwide by GDP ( PPP ) per capita . The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in 2010 , and inflation was last calculated at 1.2 percent rate in 2003 . Based on 2010 data , the islands have a high Human Development Index of 0.874 and a moderate Gini coefficient for income inequality of 34.17 . The local currency is the Falkland Islands pound , which is pegged to the British pound sterling .   Economic development was advanced by ship resupplying and sheep farming for high - quality wool . The main sheep breeds in the Falkland Islands are Polwarth and Corriedale . During the 1980s , although synthetic fibres and ranch underinvestment hurt the sheep - farming sector , the government established a major revenue stream with the establishment of an exclusive economic zone and the sale of fishing licenses to `` anybody wishing to fish within this zone '' . Since the end of the Falklands War in 1982 , the islands ' economic activity has increasingly focused on oil field exploration and tourism .   The port city of Stanley has regained the islands ' economic focus , with an increase in population as workers migrate from Camp . Fear of dependence on fishing licences and threats from overfishing , illegal fishing and fish market price fluctuations have increased interest on oil drilling as an alternative source of revenue ; exploration efforts have yet to find `` exploitable reserves '' . Development projects in education and sports have been funded by the Falklands government , without aid from the United Kingdom .   The primary sector of the economy accounts for most of the Falkland Islands ' gross domestic product , with the fishing industry alone contributing between 50 % and 60 % of annual GDP ; agriculture also contributes significantly to GDP and employs about a tenth of the population . A little over a quarter of the workforce serves the Falkland Islands government , making it the archipelago 's largest employer . Tourism , part of the service economy , has been spurred by increased interest in Antarctic exploration and the creation of direct air links with the United Kingdom and South America . Tourists , mostly cruise ship passengers , are attracted by the archipelago 's wildlife and environment , as well as activities such as fishing and wreck diving ; the majority are based in accommodation found in Stanley . The islands ' major exports include wool , hides , venison , fish and squid ; its main imports include fuel , building materials and clothing .   Demographics  See also : Origins of Falkland Islanders and Religion in the Falkland Islands The Christ Church Cathedral , the local parish church of the Anglican Communion . Most Falklanders identify themselves as Christian .  The Falkland Islands population is homogeneous , with the majority of inhabitants having been descended from Scottish and Welsh immigrants who settled the territory in 1833 . The 2006 census listed some Falklands residents as descendants of French , Gibraltarians and Scandinavians . That census indicated that one - third of residents were born on the archipelago , with foreign - born residents assimilated into local culture . The legal term for the right of residence is `` belonging to the islands '' . The British Nationality Act of 1983 gave British citizenship to Falkland Islanders .   A significant population decline affected the archipelago in the twentieth century , with many young islanders moving overseas in search of education , a modern lifestyle , and better job opportunities , particularly to the British city of Southampton , which came to be nicknamed `` Stanley north '' . In recent years , the islands ' population decline has reduced , thanks to immigrants from the United Kingdom , Saint Helena , and Chile . In the 2012 census , a majority of residents listed their nationality as Falkland Islander ( 59 percent ) , followed by British ( 29 percent ) , Saint Helenian ( 9.8 percent ) , and Chilean ( 5.4 percent ) . A small number of Argentines also live on the islands .   The Falkland Islands have a low population density . According to the 2012 census , the average daily population of the Falklands was 2,932 , excluding military personnel serving in the archipelago and their dependents . A 2012 report counted 1,300 uniformed personnel and 50 British Ministry of Defence civil servants present in the Falklands . Stanley ( with 2,121 residents ) is the most - populous location on the archipelago , followed by Mount Pleasant ( 369 residents , primarily air - base contractors ) and Camp ( 351 residents ) . The islands ' age distribution is skewed towards working age ( 20 -- 60 ) . Males outnumber females ( 53 to 47 percent ) , and this discrepancy is most prominent in the 20 -- 60 age group .   In the 2012 census , most islanders identified themselves as Christian ( 66 percent ) , followed by those with no religious affiliation ( 32 percent ) . The remaining 2 percent identified as adherents of other faiths , including Bahá'í , Buddhism , and Islam . The main Christian denominations are Anglicans , other Protestants and Roman Catholics .   Education in the Falkland Islands , which follows England 's system , is free and compulsory for residents aged between 5 and 16 years . Primary education is available at Stanley , RAF Mount Pleasant ( for children of service personnel ) and a number of rural settlements . Secondary education is only available in Stanley , which offers boarding facilities and 12 subjects to General Certificate of Secondary Education ( GCSE ) level . Students aged 16 or older may study at colleges in England for their GCE Advanced Level or vocational qualifications . The Falkland Islands government pays for older students to attend institutions of higher education , usually in the United Kingdom .   Culture  Main article : Culture of the Falkland Islands Gauchos from mainland South America , such as these two men having mate at Hope Place in East Falkland , influenced the local dialect  Falklands culture is based on the cultural traditions of its British settlers . It has also been influenced by Hispanic South America . Falklanders still use some terms and place names from the former Gaucho inhabitants . The Falklands ' predominant and official language is English , with the foremost dialect being British English ; nonetheless , inhabitants also speak Spanish and other languages . According to naturalist Will Wagstaff , `` the Falkland Islands are a very social place , and stopping for a chat is a way of life '' .   The islands have two weekly newspapers : Teaberry Express and The Penguin News , and television and radio broadcasts generally feature programming from the United Kingdom . Wagstaff describes local cuisine as `` very British in character with much use made of the homegrown vegetables , local lamb , mutton , beef , and fish '' . Common between meals are `` home made cakes and biscuits with tea or coffee '' . Social activities are , according to Wagstaff , `` typical of that of a small British town with a variety of clubs and organisations covering many aspects of community life '' .

Jump up ^ According to researcher Simon Taylor , the exact Gaelic etymology is unclear as the `` falk '' in the name could have stood for `` hidden '' ( falach ) , `` wash '' ( failc ) , or `` heavy rain '' ( falc ) .   Jump up ^ Based on his analysis of Falkland Islands discovery claims , historian John Dunmore concludes that `` ( a ) number of countries could therefore lay some claim to the archipelago under the heading of first discoverers : Spain , Holland , Britain , and even Italy and Portugal -- although the last two claimants might be stretching things a little . ''   Jump up ^ In 1764 , Bougainville claimed the islands in the name of Louis XV of France . In 1765 , British captain John Byron claimed the islands in the name of George III of Great Britain .   Jump up ^ According to Argentine legal analyst Roberto Laver , the United Kingdom disregards Jewett 's actions because the government he represented `` was not recognized either by Britain or any other foreign power at the time '' and `` no act of occupation followed the ceremony of claiming possession '' .   Jump up ^ Before leaving for the Falklands Vernet stamped his grant at the British Consulate , repeating this when Buenos Aires extended his grant in 1828 . The cordial relationship between the consulate and Vernet led him to express `` the wish that , in the event of the British returning to the islands , HMG would take his settlement under their protection '' .   Jump up ^ The log of the `` Lexington '' only reports the destruction of arms and a powder store , but Vernet made a claim for compensation from the US Government stating that the entire settlement was destroyed .   Jump up ^ As discussed by Roberto Laver , not only did Rosas not break relations with Britain because of the `` essential '' nature of `` British economic support '' , but he offered the Falklands `` as a bargaining chip ... in exchange for the cancellation of Argentina 's million - pound debt with the British bank of Baring Brothers '' . In 1850 , Rosas ' government ratified the Arana -- Southern Treaty , which put `` an end to the existing differences , and of restoring perfect relations of friendship '' between the United Kingdom and Argentina .   Jump up ^ Argentina protested in 1841 , 1849 , 1884 , 1888 , 1908 , 1927 and 1933 , and has made annual protests to the United Nations since 1946 .   Jump up ^ There were continual tensions with the colonial administration over Lafone 's failure to establish any permanent settlers , and over the price of beef supplied to the settlement . Moreover , although his concession required Lafone to bring settlers from the United Kingdom , most of the settlers he brought were gauchos from Uruguay .   Jump up ^ The minefields were fenced off and marked ; there remain unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices . Detection and clearance of mines in the Falklands has proven difficult as some were air - delivered and not in marked fields ; approximately 80 % lie in sand or peat , where the position of mines can shift , making removal procedures difficult .   Jump up ^ In 1976 , Lord Shackleton produced a report into the economic future of the islands ; however , his recommendations were not implemented because Britain sought to avoid confronting Argentina over sovereignty . Lord Shackleton was once again tasked , in 1982 , to produce a report into the economic development of the islands . His new report criticised the large farming companies , and recommended transferring ownership of farms from absentee landlords to local landowners . Shackleton also suggested diversifying the economy into fishing , oil exploration , and tourism ; moreover , he recommended the establishment of a road network , and conservation measures to preserve the islands ' natural resources .   Jump up ^ Roberto Laver argues this is likely the result of government policies which successfully reduced the number of non-British populations that at one point also inhabited the archipelago . Laver states that `` naturalization ordinances '' in the first decades of the British colony `` show a wide variety of settlers from places in Europe , Northern , and Central America , and a couple from Argentina '' .

The death squad , 601 Intelligence Battalion , directly reported to him . He was removed from power soon after the British re-took the Falkland Islands , whose invasion and occupation he had ordered .

At 17 he enrolled at the National Military Academy to study civil engineering , and his early military career was as an officer in the engineering branch . As well as rising through the ranks of the Military , he continued his studies in engineering until the mid-1950s . In 1958 , he became a professor of engineering at the Senior War College .   Galtieri was married to Lucía Noemí Gentili , and the couple had one son and two daughters .   Rise to power ( edit )   In 1975 , after more than 25 years as a combat engineer , Galtieri became commander of the Argentine engineering corps . He was an enthusiastic supporter of the military coup that started the self - styled National Reorganisation Process in 1976 and rose further , becoming a major general in 1977 , and commander - in - chief in 1980 with the rank of lieutenant general . During the junta 's rule , Congress was suspended , trade unions , political parties , and provincial governments were banned , and in what became known as the Dirty War , between 9,000 and 30,000 people deemed left - wing subversives disappeared from society . Torture and mass executions were both commonplace . The economy , which had been in dire condition prior to the coup , recovered for a short time , then deteriorated further .   In March 1981 , Galtieri visited the United States and was warmly received , as the Reagan administration viewed the regime as a bulwark against communism . National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen described him as a `` majestic general '' . An adherent to the Argentine military 's Cold War - era doctrine of `` ideological frontiers '' , Galtieri secured his country 's support for rebel groups opposing the government in Nicaragua , the Contras ; in August , he sent advisers to help organize the Nicaraguan Democratic Force ( FDN , for a time the principal Contra group ) , as well as training FDN leaders in Argentine bases . His support for this initiative allowed Galtieri to remove a number of rival generals . In December 1981 , he rose to the Presidency of Argentina in a coup that ousted General Roberto Viola . Argentine support became the principal source of funds and training for the Contras during Galtieri 's tenure .   Galtieri retained direct control of the army whilst President of the governing Military Junta and did not appoint a new commander - in - chief . He appointed conservative economist and publisher Roberto Alemann as Economy Minister . Alemann inherited an economy in deep recession in the aftermath of José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz 's economic policies of the late 1970s . Alemann slashed spending , began selling off government - owned industries ( with only minor success ) , enacted a tight monetary policy , and ordered salaries frozen ( amid 130 % inflation ) . The Central Bank Circular 1050 , which tied mortgage rates to the value of the US dollar locally , was maintained , however , leading to further deepening of the crisis ; GDP fell by 5 % , and business investment by 20 % over the weakened levels of 1981 .   One of Galtieri 's closest allies , the head of the First Army Corps , General Guillermo Suárez Mason , was named Chairman of Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales ( YPF ) , at the time the state petroleum concern , and the largest company of any type in Argentina . Suárez Mason 's turn at YPF would help result in a US $6 billion loss for the company -- the largest recorded corporate loss in the world , up to that point .   Galtieri instituted limited political reforms which allowed the expression of dissent , and anti-junta demonstrations soon became common , as did agitation for a return to democracy .

( April 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )    See also : Falklands War  In April 1982 , after Galtieri had been in office for four months and with his popularity low , Argentine forces invaded the lightly defended Falkland Islands , governed by the United Kingdom and subject to a long - standing Argentine territorial claim . The UK and other countries condemned the forcible annexation , while Peru and other Latin American countries supported it . ( The U.S. and Chile eventually joined the countries supporting the British position . )   Initially the invasion was enormously popular in Argentina , and the anti-junta demonstrations were replaced by patriotic demonstrations in support of Galtieri . On 2 April 1982 , the first day of the invasion , a small group gathered in the historic Plaza de Mayo , across from the Casa Rosada , the government site . After a while , Galtieri showed up on one of the balconies ( not the same one used by Perón but to the left of it ) and raised his hands to cheer the small group of supporters . A few minutes later , a siren was heard and many bystanders started to flee in panic , reminiscent of the tough repression that happened just a few days before in the same place , on 30 March .   Galtieri and most of his government mistakenly believed the UK would not respond militarily to his seizure and that the United States would not interfere because the junta had supported the Central Intelligence Agency in its fight against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and Galtieri had been warmly welcomed during his visit to Washington , D.C.   After diplomatic pressure and negotiations on 3 -- 4 April failed , the British Government led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher determined to restore the Falkland Islands ' sovereignty . It dispatched a seaborne combined army and naval task force to drive the Argentinian forces from the Islands , resulting in the Falklands War . Despite numerical and geo - strategic advantages possessed by Argentina over the United Kingdom 's task force in the conflict , it concluded with a British victory 10 weeks after the initial Argentinian invasion of the islands .   Defeat , fall from power , Trial and prison ( edit )   On 14 June 1982 , the Falklands ' capital , Stanley , was retaken by British forces . Within days Galtieri was removed from power , and he spent the next 18 months at a well - protected country retreat while democracy was restored to Argentina . Along with other members of the former junta , he was arrested in late 1983 and charged in a military court with human rights violations during the Dirty War and with mismanaging the Falklands War . The Argentine Army 's internal investigation , known as the Rattenbach report after the general who led it , recommended Galtieri be stripped of all rank , dismissed and face a firing squad ; however in 1986 he was sentenced to twelve years in prison .   Galtieri was cleared of the civil rights charges in December 1985 , but ( together with the Air Force and Navy commanders - in - chief ) in May 1986 he was found guilty of mishandling the war and sentenced to prison . All three appealed in a civil court , and the prosecution appealed for heavier sentences . In November 1988 the original sentences were confirmed , and all three commanders were stripped of their rank . In 1989 , Galtieri and 39 other officers of the dictatorship received President Carlos Menem 's pardon .   Later life , further accusations ( edit )   Galtieri was heavily blamed for Argentina 's humiliating defeat in the ill - conceived Falklands War . Following his release from prison , he moved to the Villa Devoto suburb of Buenos Aires , and lived modestly with his wife Lucía . He became a recluse and refused most requests for interviews by journalists , though in a rare interview he stated he had `` no regrets '' over anything he had done during the Dirty War . He lived on an army pension of about $1,800 per month , and attempted to claim a Presidential pension , but a judge denied it . In her ruling , the judge stated that his presidency had been illegal due to his never having been elected , and she also ordered him to pay court costs . In May 2002 , he was invited to the military parade of the Argentine Army for the celebrations of Argentine Army Day ( Día del Ejército Argentino ) : the presence of the former `` president de facto '' caused a huge controversy in public opinion after he was confronted and questioned by the journalist Martín Ciccioli in the television programme Kaos en la Ciudad. ( 2 )   In July 2002 , new civil charges were brought concerning the kidnapping of children and the disappearance of 18 leftist sympathizers in the late 1970s ( while Galtieri was commander of the Second Army Corps ) , and the disappearance or death of three Spanish citizens at about the same time . Galtieri faced prosecution with 28 other officials , but due to his poor health , he was allowed to remain at home . He died several months later .   Death ( edit )   Leopoldo Galtieri underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer on 16 August 2002 at a hospital in Buenos Aires . He died there of a heart attack on 12 January 2003 , aged 76 . His body was interred in a small mausoleum in La Chacarita Cemetery in the capital .

For the former manufacturing conglomerate , see Email Limited . `` Inbox '' redirects here . For the Google product , see Inbox by Gmail . This screenshot shows the `` Inbox '' page of an email client , where users can see new emails and take actions , such as reading , deleting , saving , or responding to these messages The at sign , a part of every SMTP email address  Electronic mail ( email or e-mail ) is a method of exchanging messages ( `` mail '' ) between people using electronic devices . Email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email . Email operates across computer networks , which today is primarily the Internet . Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time , in common with instant messaging . Today 's email systems are based on a store - and - forward model . Email servers accept , forward , deliver , and store messages . Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously ; they need to connect only briefly , typically to a mail server or a webmail interface , for as long as it takes to send or receive messages .   Originally an ASCII text - only communications medium , Internet email was extended by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME ) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments . International email , with internationalized email addresses using UTF - 8 , has been standardized , but as of 2017 it has not been widely adopted .   The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early ARPANET , with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 ( RFC 561 ) . An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today . Email had an important role in creating the Internet , and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services .

For example , several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe fax document transmission . As a result , it is difficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more specific meaning it has today .   Electronic mail has been most commonly called email or e-mail since around 1993 , but variations of the spelling have been used :    email is the most common form used online , and is required by IETF Requests for Comments ( RFC ) and working groups and increasingly by style guides . This spelling also appears in most dictionaries .   e-mail is the format that sometimes appears in edited , published American English and British English writing as reflected in the Corpus of Contemporary American English data , but is falling out of favor in some style guides .   mail was the form used in the original protocol standard , RFC 524 . The service is referred to as mail , and a single piece of electronic mail is called a message .   EMail is a traditional form that has been used in RFCs for the `` Author 's Address '' and is expressly required `` for historical reasons '' .   E-mail is sometimes used , capitalizing the initial E as in similar abbreviations like E-piano , E-guitar , A-bomb , and H - bomb .    An Internet e-mail consists of an envelope and content ; the content in turn consists of a header and a body .   Origin ( edit )  Main article : History of email  Computer - based mail and messaging became possible with the advent of time - sharing computers in the early 1960s , and informal methods of using shared files to pass messages were soon expanded into the first mail systems . Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar , but generally incompatible , mail applications . Over time , a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them . Many US universities were part of the ARPANET ( created in the late 1960s ) , which aimed at software portability between its systems . That portability helped make the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) increasingly influential .   For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s , it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X. 400 email system , part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile ( GOSIP ) , would predominate . However , once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995 , a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP , POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard .   Operation ( edit )   The diagram to the right shows a typical sequence of events that takes place when sender Alice transmits a message using a mail user agent ( MUA ) addressed to the email address of the recipient .  Email operation   The MUA formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol , a profile of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) , to send the message content to the local mail submission agent ( MSA ) , in this case smtp.a.org .   The MSA determines the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol ( not from the message header ) , in this case bob@b.org . The part before the @ sign is the local part of the address , often the username of the recipient , and the part after the @ sign is a domain name . The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the mail server in the Domain Name System ( DNS ) .   The DNS server for the domain b.org ( ns.b.org ) responds with any MX records listing the mail exchange servers for that domain , in this case mx.b.org , a message transfer agent ( MTA ) server run by the recipient 's ISP .   smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP . This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final message delivery agent ( MDA ) .   The MDA delivers it to the mailbox of user bob .   Bob 's MUA picks up the message using either the Post Office Protocol ( POP3 ) or the Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) .    In addition to this example , alternatives and complications exist in the email system :    Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system , such as IBM Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange . These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor - specific , proprietary protocol . The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product 's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting . If Alice and Bob work for the same company , the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system .   Alice may not have a MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service .   Alice 's computer may run its own MTA , so avoiding the transfer at step 1 .   Bob may pick up his email in many ways , for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly , or by using a webmail service .   Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available .    Many MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them . Such MTAs are called open mail relays . This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable . However , this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare , and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays .   Message format ( edit )   The Internet email message format is now defined by RFC 5322 , with encoding of non-ASCII data and multimedia content attachments being defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049 , collectively called Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME . RFC 5322 replaced the earlier RFC 2822 in 2008 , and in turn RFC 2822 in 2001 replaced RFC 822 -- which had been the standard for Internet email for nearly 20 years . Published in 1982 , RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the ARPANET .   Internet email messages consist of two major sections , the message header and the message body , collectively known as content . The header is structured into fields such as From , To , CC , Subject , Date , and other information about the email . In the process of transporting email messages between systems , SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields . The body contains the message , as unstructured text , sometimes containing a signature block at the end . The header is separated from the body by a blank line .   Message header ( edit )   Each message has exactly one header , which is structured into fields . Each field has a name and a value . RFC 5322 specifies the precise syntax .   Informally , each line of text in the header that begins with a printable character begins a separate field . The field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character `` : '' . The separator is then followed by the field value ( the `` body '' of the field ) . The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character . Field names and values are restricted to 7 - bit ASCII characters . Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words .  Header fields ( edit )  Email header fields can be multi-line , and each line should be at most 78 characters long and in no event more than 998 characters long . Header fields defined by RFC 5322 can only contain US - ASCII characters ; for encoding characters in other sets , a syntax specified in RFC 2047 can be used . Recently the IETF EAI working group has defined some standards track extensions , replacing previous experimental extensions , to allow UTF - 8 encoded Unicode characters to be used within the header . In particular , this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters . Such addresses are supported by Google and Microsoft products , and promoted by some governments .   The message header must include at least the following fields :    From : The email address , and optionally the name of the author ( s ) . In many email clients not changeable except through changing account settings .   Date : The local time and date when the message was written . Like the From : field , many email clients fill this in automatically when sending . The recipient 's client may then display the time in the format and time zone local to them .    RFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the IANA ; it provides for permanent and provisional field names , including also fields defined for MIME , netnews , and HTTP , and referencing relevant RFCs . Common header fields for email include :    To : The email address ( es ) , and optionally name ( s ) of the message 's recipient ( s ) . Indicates primary recipients ( multiple allowed ) , for secondary recipients see Cc : and Bcc : below .   Subject : A brief summary of the topic of the message . Certain abbreviations are commonly used in the subject , including `` RE : '' and `` FW : '' .   Cc : Carbon copy ; Many email clients will mark email in one 's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To : or Cc : list . ( Bcc : Blind carbon copy ; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery , and not usually listed in the message header . )   Content - Type : Information about how the message is to be displayed , usually a MIME type .   Precedence : commonly with values `` bulk '' , `` junk '' , or `` list '' ; used to indicate that automated `` vacation '' or `` out of office '' responses should not be returned for this mail , e.g. to prevent vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list . Sendmail uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email , with `` Precedence : special - delivery '' messages delivered sooner . With modern high - bandwidth networks , delivery priority is less of an issue than it once was . Microsoft Exchange respects a fine - grained automatic response suppression mechanism , the X-Auto - Response - Suppress field .   Message - ID : Also an automatically generated field ; used to prevent multiple delivery and for reference in In - Reply - To : ( see below ) .   In - Reply - To : Message - ID of the message that this is a reply to . Used to link related messages together . This field only applies for reply messages .   References : Message - ID of the message that this is a reply to , and the message - id of the message the previous reply was a reply to , etc .   Reply - To : Address that should be used to reply to the message .   Sender : Address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From : field ( secretary , list manager , etc . ) .   Archived - At : A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message .    Note that the To : field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered . The actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol , SMTP , which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content . The `` To : '' field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope . In the same way , the `` From : '' field does not have to be the real sender of the email message . Some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages being relayed . Data pertaining to server 's activity is also part of the header , as defined below .   SMTP defines the trace information of a message , which is also saved in the header using the following two fields :    Received : when an SMTP server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header ( last to first ) .   Return - Path : when the delivery SMTP server makes the final delivery of a message , it inserts this field at the top of the header .    Other fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called trace fields , in a broader sense .    Authentication - Results : when a server carries out authentication checks , it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents .   Received - SPF : stores results of SPF checks in more detail than Authentication - Results .   Auto - Submitted : is used to mark automatically generated messages .   VBR - Info : claims VBR whitelisting    Message body ( edit )  Content encoding ( edit )  Internet email was originally designed for 7 - bit ASCII . Most email software is 8 - bit clean but must assume it will communicate with 7 - bit servers and mail readers . The MIME standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data : quoted printable for mostly 7 - bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data . The 8BITMIME and BINARY extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings , but many mail transport agents still do not support them fully . In some countries , several encoding schemes coexist ; as the result , by default , the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form ( the only exception is coincidence , when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme ) . Therefore , for international character sets , Unicode is growing in popularity .  Plain text and HTML ( edit )  Most modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or HTML for the message body at the option of the user . HTML email messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well , for compatibility reasons . Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in - line links and images , set apart previous messages in block quotes , wrap naturally on any display , use emphasis such as underlines and italics , and change font styles . Disadvantages include the increased size of the email , privacy concerns about web bugs , abuse of HTML email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software .   Some web - based mailing lists recommend that all posts be made in plain - text , with 72 or 80 characters per line for all the above reasons , but also because they have a significant number of readers using text - based email clients such as Mutt . Some Microsoft email clients allow rich formatting using their proprietary Rich Text Format ( RTF ) , but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible email client .   Servers and client applications ( edit )  The interface of an email client , Thunderbird .  Messages are exchanged between hosts using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol with software programs called mail transfer agents ( MTAs ) ; and delivered to a mail store by programs called mail delivery agents ( MDAs , also sometimes called local delivery agents , LDAs ) . Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it , and when a message can not be delivered , that MTA must send a bounce message back to the sender , indicating the problem .   Users can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as POP or IMAP , or , as is more likely in a large corporate environment , with a proprietary protocol specific to Novell Groupwise , Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange Servers . Programs used by users for retrieving , reading , and managing email are called mail user agents ( MUAs ) .   Mail can be stored on the client , on the server side , or in both places . Standard formats for mailboxes include Maildir and mbox . Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them . Server - side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as IMAP , moving email from one server to another can be done with any MUA supporting the protocol .   Many current email users do not run MTA , MDA or MUA programs themselves , but use a web - based email platform , such as Gmail , Hotmail , or Yahoo ! Mail , that performs the same tasks . Such webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard web browser , from any computer , rather than relying on an email client .   Filename extensions ( edit )   Upon reception of email messages , email client applications save messages in operating system files in the file system . Some clients save individual messages as separate files , while others use various database formats , often proprietary , for collective storage . A historical standard of storage is the mbox format . The specific format used is often indicated by special filename extensions :    eml   Used by many email clients including Novell GroupWise , Microsoft Outlook Express , Lotus notes , Windows Mail , Mozilla Thunderbird , and Postbox . The files contain the email contents as plain text in MIME format , containing the email header and body , including attachments in one or more of several formats .   emlx   Used by Apple Mail .   msg   Used by Microsoft Office Outlook and OfficeLogic Groupware .   mbx   Used by Opera Mail , KMail , and Apple Mail based on the mbox format .    Some applications ( like Apple Mail ) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments . Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory .   URI scheme mailto ( edit )  Main article : mailto  The URI scheme , as registered with the IANA , defines the mailto : scheme for SMTP email addresses . Though its use is not strictly defined , URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user 's mail client when the URL is activated , with the address as defined by the URL in the To : field .   Types ( edit )   Web - based email ( edit )  Main article : Webmail  Many email providers have a web - based email client ( e.g. AOL Mail , Gmail , Outlook.com , Hotmail and Yahoo ! Mail ) . This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible web browser to send and receive their email . Mail is typically not downloaded to the client , so ca n't be read without a current Internet connection .   POP3 email services ( edit )   The Post Office Protocol 3 ( POP3 ) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server . Received messages are often deleted from the server . POP supports simple download - and - delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes ( termed maildrop in the POP RFC 's ) .   IMAP email servers ( edit )   The Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices . Small portable devices like smartphones are increasingly used to check email while travelling , and to make brief replies , larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length . IMAP shows the headers of messages , the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages . Usually mail is left in folders in the mail server .   MAPI email servers ( edit )   Messaging Application Programming Interface ( MAPI ) is used by Microsoft Outlook to communicate to Microsoft Exchange Server - and to a range of other email server products such as Axigen Mail Server , Kerio Connect , Scalix , Zimbra , HP OpenMail , IBM Lotus Notes , Zarafa , and Bynari where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook .

( November 2007 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Business and organizational use ( edit )   Email has been widely accepted by business , governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world , and it is one of the key parts of an ' e-revolution ' in workplace communication ( with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed Internet ) . A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83 % of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work .   It has some key benefits to business and other organizations , including :    Facilitating logistics   Much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building , area , or even country ; setting up and attending an in - person meeting , telephone call , or conference call can be inconvenient , time - consuming , and costly . Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set - up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call .   Helping with synchronisation   With real time communication by meetings or phone calls , participants must work on the same schedule , and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call . Email allows asynchrony : each participant may control their schedule independently .   Reducing cost   Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail , or long distance telephone calls , telex or telegrams .   Increasing speed   Much faster than most of the alternatives .   Creating a `` written '' record   Unlike a telephone or in - person conversation , email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication , the identity of the sender ( s ) and recipient ( s ) and the date and time the message was sent . In the event of a contract or legal dispute , saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues , as each email has the date and time recorded on it .   Email marketing ( edit )  Email marketing via `` opt - in '' is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information . Depending on the recipient 's culture , email sent without permission -- such as an `` opt - in '' -- is likely to be viewed as unwelcome `` email spam '' .   Personal use ( edit )  Personal computer ( edit )  Many users access their personal email from friends and family members using a personal computer in their house or apartment .  Mobile ( edit )  Email has become used on smartphones and on all types of computers . Mobile `` apps '' for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their home . While in the earliest years of email , users could only access email on desktop computers , in the 2010s , it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home , whether they are across town or across the world . Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other device to notify them immediately of new messages . This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day . As of 2011 , there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily .   Individuals often check email on smartphones for both personal and work - related messages . It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their Facebook accounts , making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones . 78 % of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone . It was also found that 30 % of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email , and 91 % were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone . However , the percentage of consumers using email on smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries . For example , in comparison to 75 % of those consumers in the US who used it , only 17 % in India did .  Declining use among Young people ( edit )  As of 2010 , the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009 . For persons 12 to 17 , the number was down 18 percent . Young people preferred instant messaging , texting and social media , and email was not designed for them anyway . Technology writer Matt Richtel said in The New York Times that email was like the VCR , vinyl records and film cameras -- no longer cool and something older people do .   A 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45 , and were far less likely to use email .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( October 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Attachment size limitation ( edit )  Main article : Email attachment  Email messages may have one or more attachments , which are additional files that are appended to the email . Typical attachments include Microsoft Word documents , pdf documents and scanned images of paper documents . In principle there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments , but in practice email clients , servers and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files , or complete email - typically to 25MB or less . Furthermore , due to technical reasons , attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ to what the user sees , which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email . Where larger files need to be shared , file hosting services of various sorts are available ; and generally suggested . Some large files , such as digital photos , color presentations and video or music files are too large for some email systems .   Information overload ( edit )   The ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and `` white collar '' employees has led to concerns that recipients face an `` information overload '' in dealing with increasing volumes of email . With the growth in mobile devices , by default employees may also receive work - related emails outside of their working day . This can lead to increased stress , decreased satisfaction with work , and some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect , as efforts to read the many emails could reduce productivity .   Spam ( edit )  Main article : Email spam  Email `` spam '' is the term used to describe unsolicited bulk email . The low cost of sending such email meant that by 2003 up to 30 % of total email traffic was already spam. and was threatening the usefulness of email as a practical tool . The US CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws elsewhere had some impact , and a number of effective anti-spam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users , but the volume sent is still very high -- and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products , but malicious content or links .   Malware ( edit )   A range of malicious email types exist . These range from various types of email scams , including `` social engineering '' scams such as advance - fee scam `` Nigerian letters '' , to phishing , email bombardment and email worms .   Email spoofing ( edit )  Main article : Email spoofing  Email spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source . Email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin . Email spoofing may be done as a prank , or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization . An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email which appears to be an invoice from a major company , and then sends it to one or more recipients . In some cases , these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate .   Email bombing ( edit )  Main article : Email bomb  Email bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address . The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash .   Privacy concerns ( edit )  Main article : Email privacy  Today it can be important to distinguish between Internet and internal email systems . Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender 's or the recipient 's control . During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content . Internal mail systems , in which the information never leaves the organizational network , may be more secure , although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees .   Email privacy , without some security precautions , can be compromised because :    email messages are generally not encrypted .   email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination , meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages .   many Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered . The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server , despite deletion from the mailbox .   the `` Received : '' - fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender , preventing anonymous communication .   web bugs invisibly embedded in email content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is read , or re-read , and from which IP address . It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC , or Apple Mac device via the user agent string .    There are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above . For example , Virtual Private Networks or the Tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG , PGP , SMEmail , or S / MIME can be used for end - to - end message encryption , and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server .   Additionally , many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords , making them easy to intercept by an attacker . Encrypted authentication schemes such as SASL prevent this . Finally , attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peer - to - peer filesharing . Attached files may contain trojans or viruses .   Flaming ( edit )   Flaming occurs when a person sends a message ( or many messages ) with angry or antagonistic content . The term is derived from the use of the word `` incendiary '' to describe particularly heated email discussions . The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten .   Email bankruptcy ( edit )  Main article : Email bankruptcy  Also known as `` email fatigue '' , email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them . The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all . As a solution , people occasionally send a `` boilerplate '' message explaining that their email inbox is full , and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages . Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig is credited with coining this term , but he may only have popularized it .   Internationalization ( edit )   Originally Internet email was completely ASCII text - based . MIME now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets , but other headers and email addresses using UTF - 8 , while standardized have yet to be widely adopted .  Further information : International email and Email address § Internationalization  Tracking of sent mail ( edit )   The original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message , and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read . It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice ( bounce message ) , but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost . To remedy this , the IETF introduced Delivery Status Notifications ( delivery receipts ) and Message Disposition Notifications ( return receipts ) ; however , these are not universally deployed in production . ( A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined , but it never gained traction ; see RFCs 3885 through 3888 . )   Many ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports ( NDRs ) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers :    Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so , this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed .   If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ( email spoofing ) , then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail . These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user .    In the absence of standard methods , a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed . However , these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns , and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML . Many mail clients now default to not showing `` web content '' . Webmail providers can also disrupt web bugs by pre-caching images .

For the former manufacturing conglomerate , see Email Limited . `` Inbox '' redirects here . For the Google product , see Inbox by Gmail . This screenshot shows the `` Inbox '' page of an email client , where users can see new emails and take actions , such as reading , deleting , saving , or responding to these messages The at sign , a part of every SMTP email address  Electronic mail ( email or e-mail ) is a method of exchanging messages ( `` mail '' ) between people using electronic devices . Invented by Ray Tomlinson , email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email . Email operates across computer networks , which today is primarily the Internet . Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time , in common with instant messaging . Today 's email systems are based on a store - and - forward model . Email servers accept , forward , deliver , and store messages . Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously ; they need to connect only briefly , typically to a mail server or a webmail interface , for as long as it takes to send or receive messages .   Originally an ASCII text - only communications medium , Internet email was extended by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME ) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments . International email , with internationalized email addresses using UTF - 8 , has been standardized , but as of 2017 it has not been widely adopted .   The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early ARPANET , with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 ( RFC 561 ) . An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today . Email had an important role in creating the Internet , and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services .

For example , several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe fax document transmission . As a result , it is difficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more specific meaning it has today .   Electronic mail has been most commonly called email or e-mail since around 1993 , but variations of the spelling have been used :    email is the most common form used online , and is required by IETF Requests for Comments ( RFC ) and working groups and increasingly by style guides . This spelling also appears in most dictionaries .   e-mail is the format that sometimes appears in edited , published American English and British English writing as reflected in the Corpus of Contemporary American English data , but is falling out of favor in some style guides .   mail was the form used in the original protocol standard , RFC 524 . The service is referred to as mail , and a single piece of electronic mail is called a message .   EMail is a traditional form that has been used in RFCs for the `` Author 's Address '' and is expressly required `` for historical reasons '' .   E-mail is sometimes used , capitalizing the initial E as in similar abbreviations like E-piano , E-guitar , A-bomb , and H - bomb .    An Internet e-mail consists of an envelope and content ; the content in turn consists of a header and a body .   Origin ( edit )  Main article : History of email  Computer - based mail and messaging became possible with the advent of time - sharing computers in the early 1960s , and informal methods of using shared files to pass messages were soon expanded into the first mail systems . Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar , but generally incompatible , mail applications . Over time , a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them . Many US universities were part of the ARPANET ( created in the late 1960s ) , which aimed at software portability between its systems . That portability helped make the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) increasingly influential .   For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s , it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X. 400 email system , part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile ( GOSIP ) , would predominate . However , once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995 , a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP , POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard .   Operation ( edit )   The diagram to the right shows a typical sequence of events that takes place when sender Alice transmits a message using a mail user agent ( MUA ) addressed to the email address of the recipient .  Email operation   The MUA formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol , a profile of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) , to send the message content to the local mail submission agent ( MSA ) , in this case smtp.a.org .   The MSA determines the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol ( not from the message header ) , in this case bob@b.org . The part before the @ sign is the local part of the address , often the username of the recipient , and the part after the @ sign is a domain name . The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the mail server in the Domain Name System ( DNS ) .   The DNS server for the domain b.org ( ns.b.org ) responds with any MX records listing the mail exchange servers for that domain , in this case mx.b.org , a message transfer agent ( MTA ) server run by the recipient 's ISP .   smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP . This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final message delivery agent ( MDA ) .   The MDA delivers it to the mailbox of user bob .   Bob 's MUA picks up the message using either the Post Office Protocol ( POP3 ) or the Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) .    In addition to this example , alternatives and complications exist in the email system :    Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system , such as IBM Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange . These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor - specific , proprietary protocol . The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product 's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting . If Alice and Bob work for the same company , the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system .   Alice may not have a MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service .   Alice 's computer may run its own MTA , so avoiding the transfer at step 1 .   Bob may pick up his email in many ways , for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly , or by using a webmail service .   Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available .    Many MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them . Such MTAs are called open mail relays . This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable . However , this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare , and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays .   Message format ( edit )   The Internet email message format is now defined by RFC 5322 , with encoding of non-ASCII data and multimedia content attachments being defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049 , collectively called Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME . RFC 5322 replaced the earlier RFC 2822 in 2008 , and in turn RFC 2822 in 2001 replaced RFC 822 -- which had been the standard for Internet email for nearly 20 years . Published in 1982 , RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the ARPANET .   Internet email messages consist of two major sections , the message header and the message body , collectively known as content . The header is structured into fields such as From , To , CC , Subject , Date , and other information about the email . In the process of transporting email messages between systems , SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields . The body contains the message , as unstructured text , sometimes containing a signature block at the end . The header is separated from the body by a blank line .   Message header ( edit )   Each message has exactly one header , which is structured into fields . Each field has a name and a value . RFC 5322 specifies the precise syntax .   Informally , each line of text in the header that begins with a printable character begins a separate field . The field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character `` : '' . The separator is then followed by the field value ( the `` body '' of the field ) . The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character . Field names and values are restricted to 7 - bit ASCII characters . Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words .  Header fields ( edit )  Email header fields can be multi-line , and each line should be at most 78 characters long and in no event more than 998 characters long . Header fields defined by RFC 5322 can only contain US - ASCII characters ; for encoding characters in other sets , a syntax specified in RFC 2047 can be used . Recently the IETF EAI working group has defined some standards track extensions , replacing previous experimental extensions , to allow UTF - 8 encoded Unicode characters to be used within the header . In particular , this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters . Such addresses are supported by Google and Microsoft products , and promoted by some governments .   The message header must include at least the following fields :    From : The email address , and optionally the name of the author ( s ) . In many email clients not changeable except through changing account settings .   Date : The local time and date when the message was written . Like the From : field , many email clients fill this in automatically when sending . The recipient 's client may then display the time in the format and time zone local to them .    RFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the IANA ; it provides for permanent and provisional field names , including also fields defined for MIME , netnews , and HTTP , and referencing relevant RFCs . Common header fields for email include :    To : The email address ( es ) , and optionally name ( s ) of the message 's recipient ( s ) . Indicates primary recipients ( multiple allowed ) , for secondary recipients see Cc : and Bcc : below .   Subject : A brief summary of the topic of the message . Certain abbreviations are commonly used in the subject , including `` RE : '' and `` FW : '' .   Cc : Carbon copy ; Many email clients will mark email in one 's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To : or Cc : list . ( Bcc : Blind carbon copy ; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery , and not usually listed in the message header . )   Content - Type : Information about how the message is to be displayed , usually a MIME type .   Precedence : commonly with values `` bulk '' , `` junk '' , or `` list '' ; used to indicate that automated `` vacation '' or `` out of office '' responses should not be returned for this mail , e.g. to prevent vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list . Sendmail uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email , with `` Precedence : special - delivery '' messages delivered sooner . With modern high - bandwidth networks , delivery priority is less of an issue than it once was . Microsoft Exchange respects a fine - grained automatic response suppression mechanism , the X-Auto - Response - Suppress field .   Message - ID : Also an automatically generated field ; used to prevent multiple delivery and for reference in In - Reply - To : ( see below ) .   In - Reply - To : Message - ID of the message that this is a reply to . Used to link related messages together . This field only applies for reply messages .   References : Message - ID of the message that this is a reply to , and the message - id of the message the previous reply was a reply to , etc .   Reply - To : Address that should be used to reply to the message .   Sender : Address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From : field ( secretary , list manager , etc . ) .   Archived - At : A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message .    Note that the To : field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered . The actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol , SMTP , which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content . The `` To : '' field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope . In the same way , the `` From : '' field does not have to be the real sender of the email message . Some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages being relayed . Data pertaining to server 's activity is also part of the header , as defined below .   SMTP defines the trace information of a message , which is also saved in the header using the following two fields :    Received : when an SMTP server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header ( last to first ) .   Return - Path : when the delivery SMTP server makes the final delivery of a message , it inserts this field at the top of the header .    Other fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called trace fields , in a broader sense .    Authentication - Results : when a server carries out authentication checks , it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents .   Received - SPF : stores results of SPF checks in more detail than Authentication - Results .   Auto - Submitted : is used to mark automatically generated messages .   VBR - Info : claims VBR whitelisting    Message body ( edit )  Content encoding ( edit )  Internet email was originally designed for 7 - bit ASCII . Most email software is 8 - bit clean but must assume it will communicate with 7 - bit servers and mail readers . The MIME standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data : quoted printable for mostly 7 - bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data . The 8BITMIME and BINARY extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings , but many mail transport agents still do not support them fully . In some countries , several encoding schemes coexist ; as the result , by default , the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form ( the only exception is coincidence , when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme ) . Therefore , for international character sets , Unicode is growing in popularity .  Plain text and HTML ( edit )  Most modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or HTML for the message body at the option of the user . HTML email messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well , for compatibility reasons . Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in - line links and images , set apart previous messages in block quotes , wrap naturally on any display , use emphasis such as underlines and italics , and change font styles . Disadvantages include the increased size of the email , privacy concerns about web bugs , abuse of HTML email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software .   Some web - based mailing lists recommend that all posts be made in plain - text , with 72 or 80 characters per line for all the above reasons , but also because they have a significant number of readers using text - based email clients such as Mutt . Some Microsoft email clients allow rich formatting using their proprietary Rich Text Format ( RTF ) , but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible email client .   Servers and client applications ( edit )  The interface of an email client , Thunderbird .  Messages are exchanged between hosts using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol with software programs called mail transfer agents ( MTAs ) ; and delivered to a mail store by programs called mail delivery agents ( MDAs , also sometimes called local delivery agents , LDAs ) . Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it , and when a message can not be delivered , that MTA must send a bounce message back to the sender , indicating the problem .   Users can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as POP or IMAP , or , as is more likely in a large corporate environment , with a proprietary protocol specific to Novell Groupwise , Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange Servers . Programs used by users for retrieving , reading , and managing email are called mail user agents ( MUAs ) .   Mail can be stored on the client , on the server side , or in both places . Standard formats for mailboxes include Maildir and mbox . Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them . Server - side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as IMAP , moving email from one server to another can be done with any MUA supporting the protocol .   Many current email users do not run MTA , MDA or MUA programs themselves , but use a web - based email platform , such as Gmail , Hotmail , or Yahoo ! Mail , that performs the same tasks . Such webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard web browser , from any computer , rather than relying on an email client .   Filename extensions ( edit )   Upon reception of email messages , email client applications save messages in operating system files in the file system . Some clients save individual messages as separate files , while others use various database formats , often proprietary , for collective storage . A historical standard of storage is the mbox format . The specific format used is often indicated by special filename extensions :    eml   Used by many email clients including Novell GroupWise , Microsoft Outlook Express , Lotus notes , Windows Mail , Mozilla Thunderbird , and Postbox . The files contain the email contents as plain text in MIME format , containing the email header and body , including attachments in one or more of several formats .   emlx   Used by Apple Mail .   msg   Used by Microsoft Office Outlook and OfficeLogic Groupware .   mbx   Used by Opera Mail , KMail , and Apple Mail based on the mbox format .    Some applications ( like Apple Mail ) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments . Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory .   URI scheme mailto ( edit )  Main article : mailto  The URI scheme , as registered with the IANA , defines the mailto : scheme for SMTP email addresses . Though its use is not strictly defined , URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user 's mail client when the URL is activated , with the address as defined by the URL in the To : field .   Types ( edit )   Web - based email ( edit )  Main article : Webmail  Many email providers have a web - based email client ( e.g. AOL Mail , Gmail , Outlook.com , Hotmail and Yahoo ! Mail ) . This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible web browser to send and receive their email . Mail is typically not downloaded to the client , so ca n't be read without a current Internet connection .   POP3 email services ( edit )   The Post Office Protocol 3 ( POP3 ) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server . Received messages are often deleted from the server . POP supports simple download - and - delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes ( termed maildrop in the POP RFC 's ) .   IMAP email servers ( edit )   The Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices . Small portable devices like smartphones are increasingly used to check email while travelling , and to make brief replies , larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length . IMAP shows the headers of messages , the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages . Usually mail is left in folders in the mail server .   MAPI email servers ( edit )   Messaging Application Programming Interface ( MAPI ) is used by Microsoft Outlook to communicate to Microsoft Exchange Server - and to a range of other email server products such as Axigen Mail Server , Kerio Connect , Scalix , Zimbra , HP OpenMail , IBM Lotus Notes , Zarafa , and Bynari where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook .

( November 2007 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Business and organizational use ( edit )   Email has been widely accepted by business , governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world , and it is one of the key parts of an ' e-revolution ' in workplace communication ( with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed Internet ) . A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83 % of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work .   It has some key benefits to business and other organizations , including :    Facilitating logistics   Much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building , area , or even country ; setting up and attending an in - person meeting , telephone call , or conference call can be inconvenient , time - consuming , and costly . Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set - up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call .   Helping with synchronisation   With real time communication by meetings or phone calls , participants must work on the same schedule , and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call . Email allows asynchrony : each participant may control their schedule independently .   Reducing cost   Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail , or long distance telephone calls , telex or telegrams .   Increasing speed   Much faster than most of the alternatives .   Creating a `` written '' record   Unlike a telephone or in - person conversation , email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication , the identity of the sender ( s ) and recipient ( s ) and the date and time the message was sent . In the event of a contract or legal dispute , saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues , as each email has the date and time recorded on it .   Email marketing ( edit )  Email marketing via `` opt - in '' is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information . Depending on the recipient 's culture , email sent without permission -- such as an `` opt - in '' -- is likely to be viewed as unwelcome `` email spam '' .   Personal use ( edit )  Personal computer ( edit )  Many users access their personal email from friends and family members using a personal computer in their house or apartment .  Mobile ( edit )  Email has become used on smartphones and on all types of computers . Mobile `` apps '' for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their home . While in the earliest years of email , users could only access email on desktop computers , in the 2010s , it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home , whether they are across town or across the world . Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other device to notify them immediately of new messages . This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day . As of 2011 , there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily .   Individuals often check email on smartphones for both personal and work - related messages . It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their Facebook accounts , making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones . 78 % of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone . It was also found that 30 % of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email , and 91 % were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone . However , the percentage of consumers using email on smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries . For example , in comparison to 75 % of those consumers in the US who used it , only 17 % in India did .  Declining use among Young people ( edit )  As of 2010 , the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009 . For persons 12 to 17 , the number was down 18 percent . Young people preferred instant messaging , texting and social media . Technology writer Matt Richtel said in The New York Times that email was like the VCR , vinyl records and film cameras -- no longer cool and something older people do .   A 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45 , and were far less likely to use email .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( October 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Attachment size limitation ( edit )  Main article : Email attachment  Email messages may have one or more attachments , which are additional files that are appended to the email . Typical attachments include Microsoft Word documents , pdf documents and scanned images of paper documents . In principle there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments , but in practice email clients , servers and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files , or complete email - typically to 25MB or less . Furthermore , due to technical reasons , attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ to what the user sees , which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email . Where larger files need to be shared , file hosting services of various sorts are available ; and generally suggested . Some large files , such as digital photos , color presentations and video or music files are too large for some email systems .   Information overload ( edit )   The ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and `` white collar '' employees has led to concerns that recipients face an `` information overload '' in dealing with increasing volumes of email . With the growth in mobile devices , by default employees may also receive work - related emails outside of their working day . This can lead to increased stress , decreased satisfaction with work , and some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect , as efforts to read the many emails could reduce productivity .   Spam ( edit )  Main article : Email spam  Email `` spam '' is the term used to describe unsolicited bulk email . The low cost of sending such email meant that by 2003 up to 30 % of total email traffic was already spam. and was threatening the usefulness of email as a practical tool . The US CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws elsewhere had some impact , and a number of effective anti-spam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users , but the volume sent is still very high -- and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products , but malicious content or links .   Malware ( edit )   A range of malicious email types exist . These range from various types of email scams , including `` social engineering '' scams such as advance - fee scam `` Nigerian letters '' , to phishing , email bombardment and email worms .   Email spoofing ( edit )  Main article : Email spoofing  Email spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source . Email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin . Email spoofing may be done as a prank , or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization . An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email which appears to be an invoice from a major company , and then sends it to one or more recipients . In some cases , these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate .   Email bombing ( edit )  Main article : Email bomb  Email bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address . The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash .   Privacy concerns ( edit )  Main article : Email privacy  Today it can be important to distinguish between Internet and internal email systems . Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender 's or the recipient 's control . During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content . Internal mail systems , in which the information never leaves the organizational network , may be more secure , although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees .   Email privacy , without some security precautions , can be compromised because :    email messages are generally not encrypted .   email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination , meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages .   many Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered . The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server , despite deletion from the mailbox .   the `` Received : '' - fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender , preventing anonymous communication .   web bugs invisibly embedded in email content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is read , or re-read , and from which IP address . It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC , or Apple Mac device via the user agent string .    There are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above . For example , Virtual Private Networks or the Tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG , PGP , SMEmail , or S / MIME can be used for end - to - end message encryption , and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server .   Additionally , many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords , making them easy to intercept by an attacker . Encrypted authentication schemes such as SASL prevent this . Finally , attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peer - to - peer filesharing . Attached files may contain trojans or viruses .   Flaming ( edit )   Flaming occurs when a person sends a message ( or many messages ) with angry or antagonistic content . The term is derived from the use of the word `` incendiary '' to describe particularly heated email discussions . The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten .   Email bankruptcy ( edit )  Main article : Email bankruptcy  Also known as `` email fatigue '' , email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them . The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all . As a solution , people occasionally send a `` boilerplate '' message explaining that their email inbox is full , and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages . Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig is credited with coining this term , but he may only have popularized it .   Internationalization ( edit )   Originally Internet email was completely ASCII text - based . MIME now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets , but other headers and email addresses using UTF - 8 , while standardized have yet to be widely adopted .  Further information : International email and Email address § Internationalization  Tracking of sent mail ( edit )   The original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message , and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read . It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice ( bounce message ) , but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost . To remedy this , the IETF introduced Delivery Status Notifications ( delivery receipts ) and Message Disposition Notifications ( return receipts ) ; however , these are not universally deployed in production . ( A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined , but it never gained traction ; see RFCs 3885 through 3888 . )   Many ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports ( NDRs ) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers :    Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so , this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed .   If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ( email spoofing ) , then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail . These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user .    In the absence of standard methods , a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed . However , these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns , and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML . Many mail clients now default to not showing `` web content '' . Webmail providers can also disrupt web bugs by pre-caching images .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads .

Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns .   Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured .   Types   Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails :   Transactional emails   Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts .   The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services .   Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) .   Direct emails   Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used .  Mobile email marketing  Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy .   Comparison to traditional mail   There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail .   Advantages   Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons :    An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic .   Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing .   Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior .   Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital .   Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email .   Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates .   Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK .   If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses .    Disadvantages   As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % .   Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day .   Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy .   Opt - in email advertising   Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing .   Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements .   A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter .   With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments .   Legal requirements   Australia   The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) .   Canada   The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses .   European Union   In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses .   The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication .   United states   The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission .   In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages .   The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 .

A wide variety of formats were used in early email systems , but only a single format is used today , following the standards developed for Internet mail systems since the 1980s . This article uses the term email address to refer to the addr - spec defined in RFC 5322 , not to the address that is commonly used ; the difference is that an address may contain a display name , a comment , or both .   An email address such as John.Smith@example.com is made up of a local - part , an @ symbol , then a case - insensitive domain . Although the standard specifies the local part to be case - sensitive , in practice the mail system at example.com may treat John. Smith as equivalent to JohnSmith or even as johnsmith , and mail systems often limit their users ' choice of name to a subset of the technically valid characters . In some cases they also limit which addresses it is possible to send mail to .   With the introduction of internationalized domain names , efforts are progressing to permit non-ASCII characters in email addresses .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Overview   2 Syntax   2.1 Local - part   2.2 Domain   2.3 Examples     3 Common local - part semantics   3.1 Local - part normalization   3.2 Subaddressing     4 Validation and verification   4.1 Identity validation     5 Internationalization   5.1 Internationalization examples   5.2 Internationalization support     6 Standards documents   7 See also   8 References   9 External links      Overview ( edit )   The transmission of electronic mail within the Internet uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) , defined in Internet standards RFC 5321 and RFC 5322 , and extensions like RFC 6531 . The mailboxes may be accessed and managed by users with the Post Office Protocol ( POP ) or the Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) with email client software that runs on a personal computer , mobile device , or with webmail systems that render the messages on a screen or on paper printouts .   The general format of an email address is local-part@domain , and a specific example is jsmith@example.com . An address consists of two parts . The part before the @ symbol ( local - part ) identifies the name of a mailbox . This is often the username of the recipient , e.g. , jsmith . The part after the @ symbol ( domain ) is a domain name that represents the administrative realm for the mail box , e.g. , a company 's domain name , example.com .   When delivering email , a mail server ( mail transfer agent : MTA ) uses the domain name system ( DNS ) to look up the mail exchanger record ( MX record ) for the recipient 's domain ( the part of the email address on the right of @ ) . The returned MX record contains the name of the recipient 's mailserver . The MTA next connects to this server as an SMTP client .   The local part of an email address has no significance for intermediate mail relay systems other than the final mailbox host . Email senders and intermediate relay systems must not assume it to be case - insensitive , since the final mailbox host may or may not treat it as such . A single mailbox may receive mail for multiple email addresses , if configured by the administrator . Conversely , a single email address may be the alias to a distribution list to many mailboxes . Email aliases , electronic mailing lists , sub-addressing , and catch - all addresses , the latter being mailboxes that receive messages regardless of the local part , are common patterns for achieving a variety of delivery goals .   The addresses found in the header fields of an email message are not directly used by mail exchangers to deliver the message . An email message also contains a message envelope that contains the information for mail routing . While envelope and header addresses may be equal , forged email addresses are often seen in spam , phishing , and many other Internet - based scams . This has led to several initiatives which aim to make such forgeries easier to spot .   To indicate the message recipient , an email address also may have an associated display name for the recipient , which is followed by the address specification surrounded by angled brackets , for example : John Smith  .   Earlier forms of email addresses on other networks than the Internet included other notations , such as that required by X. 400 , and the UUCP bang path notation , in which the address was given in the form of a sequence of computers through which the message should be relayed . This was widely used for several years , but was superseded by the Internet standards promulgated by the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) .   Syntax ( edit )   The format of email addresses is local-part@domain where the local part may be up to 64 characters long and the domain may have a maximum of 255 characters . The formal definitions are in RFC 5322 ( sections 3.2. 3 and 3.4. 1 ) and RFC 5321 -- with a more readable form given in the informational RFC 3696 and the associated errata . Note that unlike the syntax of RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 , there is no trailing period in the domain name .   Local - part ( edit )   The local - part of the email address may use any of these ASCII characters :    uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z ;   digits 0 to 9 ;   special characters ! # $ % & ' * + - / = ? ^ _ ` ( ) ~ ;     dot . , provided that it is not the first or last character unless quoted , and provided also that it does not appear consecutively unless quoted ( e.g. John ... Doe@example.com is not allowed but `` John ... Doe '' @ example.com is allowed ) ;    Note that characters after a plus sign + are generally ignored , so fred+bah@domain and fred+foo@domain will end up in the same inbox as fred@domain This can be useful for tagging emails for sorting , see below . The minus sign - is also used in that fashion , although less often .    space and `` ( ) , : ;  @ ( \\\\ ) characters are allowed with restrictions ( they are only allowed inside a quoted string , as described in the paragraph below , and in addition , a backslash or double - quote must be preceded by a backslash ) ;   comments are allowed with parentheses at either end of the local - part ; e.g. john. smith ( comment ) @ example.com and ( comment ) john.smith@example.com are both equivalent to john.smith@example.com .    In addition to the above ASCII characters , international characters above U + 007F , encoded as UTF - 8 , are permitted by RFC 6531 , though even mail systems that support SMTPUTF8 and 8BITMIME may restrict which characters to use when assigning local - parts .   A local part is either a Dot - string or a Quoted - string ; it can not be a combination . Quoted strings and characters however , are not commonly used . RFC 5321 also warns that `` a host that expects to receive mail SHOULD avoid defining mailboxes where the Local - part requires ( or uses ) the Quoted - string form '' .   The local - part postmaster is treated specially -- it is case - insensitive , and should be forwarded to the domain email administrator . Technically all other local - parts are case - sensitive , therefore jsmith@example.com and JSmith@example.com specify different mailboxes ; however , many organizations treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent . Indeed , RFC 5321 warns that `` a host that expects to receive mail SHOULD avoid defining mailboxes where ... the Local - part is case - sensitive '' .   Despite the wide range of special characters which are technically valid , organisations , mail services , mail servers and mail clients in practice often do not accept all of them . For example , Windows Live Hotmail only allows creation of email addresses using alphanumerics , dot ( . ) , underscore ( _ ) and hyphen ( - ) . Common advice is to avoid using some special characters to avoid the risk of rejected emails .   Domain ( edit )   The domain name part of an email address has to conform to strict guidelines : it must match the requirements for a hostname , a list of dot - separated DNS labels , each label being limited to a length of 63 characters and consisting of :    uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z ;   digits 0 to 9 , provided that top - level domain names are not all - numeric ;   hyphen - , provided that it is not the first or last character .    This rule is known as the LDH rule ( letters , digits , hyphen ) . In addition , the domain may be an IP address literal , surrounded by square brackets ( ) , such as jsmith @ ( 192.168. 2.1 ) or jsmith @ ( IPv6 : 2001 : db8 : : 1 ) , although this is rarely seen except in email spam . Internationalized domain names ( which are encoded to comply with the requirements for a hostname ) allow for presentation of non-ASCII domains . In mail systems compliant with RFC 6531 and RFC 6532 an email address may be encoded as UTF - 8 , both a local - part as well as a domain name .   Comments are allowed in the domain as well as in the local - part ; for example , john. smith @ ( comment ) example.com and john.smith@example.com ( comment ) are equivalent to john.smith@example.com .   Examples ( edit )    Valid email addresses   prettyandsimple@example.com   very.common@example.com   disposable.style.email.with+symbol@example.com   other.email-with-dash@example.com   fully-qualified-domain@example.com   user.name+tag+sorting@example.com ( will go to user.name@example.com inbox )   x@example.com ( one - letter local - part )     `` very.

VERY. \\\\ `` very @ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ '' very \\\\ ``. unusual '' @ strange.example.com   example-indeed@strange-example.com   admin@mailserver1 ( local domain name with no TLD , although ICANN highly discourages dotless email addresses )   # ! $ % & ' * + - / = ? ^ _ ` ( ) ~ @ example.org   `` ( )  ( ) : , ; @ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ '' ! # $ % & ' - / = ? ^ _ ` ( ) ~. a `` @ example.org     example@s.solutions ( see the List of Internet top - level domains )   user@localserver   user @ ( 2001 : DB8 : : 1 )     Invalid email addresses   Abc.example.com ( no @ character )   A@b @ c@example.com ( only one @ is allowed outside quotation marks )   a `` b ( c ) d , e : f ; g  i ( j \\\\ k ) l@example.com ( none of the special characters in this local - part are allowed outside quotation marks )   just `` not '' right@example.com ( quoted strings must be dot separated or the only element making up the local - part )   this is `` not \\\\ allowed@example.com ( spaces , quotes , and backslashes may only exist when within quoted strings and preceded by a backslash )   this \\\\ still \\\\ `` not \\\\ \\\\ allowed@example.com ( even if escaped ( preceded by a backslash ) , spaces , quotes , and backslashes must still be contained by quotes )   1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234+x@example.com ( too long )   john ... doe@example.com ( double dot before @ )   example@localhost ( sent from localhost )   with caveat : Gmail lets this through , Email address # Local - part the dots altogether     john.doe@example ... com ( double dot after @ )   `` `` @ example.org ( space between the quotes )   `` very. unusual. @. unusual.com '' @ example.com   Duy   a valid address with a leading space   a valid address with a trailing space    Common local - part semantics ( edit )   According to RFC 5321 2.3. 11 Mailbox and Address , `` ... the local - part MUST be interpreted and assigned semantics only by the host specified in the domain of the address . '' This means that no assumptions can be made about the meaning of the local - part of another mail server . It is entirely up to the configuration of the mail server .   Local - part normalization ( edit )   Interpretation of the local part of an email address is dependent on the conventions and policies implemented in the mail server . For example , case sensitivity may distinguish mailboxes differing only in capitalization of characters of the local - part , although this is not very common . Gmail ignores all dots in the local - part for the purposes of determining account identity . This prevents the creation of user accounts your.user.name or yourusername when the account your. username already exists .   Sub-addressing ( edit )   Some mail services support a tag appended to the local - part , such that the modified address is an alias to the unmodified one . For example , the address joeuser+tag@example.com denotes the same delivery address as joeuser@example.com . RFC 5233 , refers to this convention as sub-addressing , but it is also known as plus addressing or tagged addressing .   Addresses of this form , using various separators between the base name and the tag , are supported by several email services , including Runbox ( plus ) , Gmail ( plus ) , Yahoo ! Mail Plus ( hyphen ) , Apple 's iCloud ( plus ) , Outlook.com ( plus ) , ProtonMail ( plus ) , FastMail ( plus and Subdomain Addressing ) , MMDF ( equals ) , Qmail and Courier Mail Server ( hyphen ) . Postfix allows configuring an arbitrary separator from the legal character set .   The text of the tag may be used to apply filtering , or to create single - use , or disposable email addresses .   In practice , the form validation of some web sites may reject special characters such as `` + '' in an email address -- treating them , incorrectly , as invalid characters . This can lead to an incorrect user receiving an e-mail if the `` + '' is silently stripped by a website without any warning or error messages . For example , an email intended for the user - entered email address foo+bar@example.com could be incorrectly sent to foobar@example.com . In other cases a poor user experience can occur if some parts of a site , such as a user registration page , allow the `` + '' character whilst other parts , such as a page for unsubscribing from a site 's mailing list , do not .   Validation and verification ( edit )   Email addresses are often requested as input to website as user identification for the purpose of data validation . While there are companies that provide services to validate an email address at the time of entry , normally using an Application programming interface , there is no guarantee that it will provide accurate results .   An email address is generally recognized as having two parts joined with an at - sign ( @ ) . However , the technical specification detailed in RFC 822 and subsequent RFCs are more extensive . A regular expression can be used to check for all of these criteria , except that of bracketed nested comments .   Syntactically correct , verified email addresses do not guarantee email box existence . Thus many mail servers use other techniques and check the mailbox existence against relevant systems such as the Domain Name System for the domain or using callback verification to check if the mailbox exists . This is however often disabled to avoid directory harvest attack .   Assuring an email address is of a good quality requires a combination of various validation techniques . Large websites , bulk mailers and spammers require fast algorithms that predict validity of email address . Such methods depend heavily on heuristic algorithms and statistical models .   Many websites evaluate the validity of email addresses differently than the standards specify , rejecting addresses containing valid characters , such as + and / , or enforcing arbitrary length limitations . RFC 3696 provides specific advice for validating Internet identifiers , including email addresses .   HTML5 forms implemented in many browsers , allow email address validation to be handled by the browser .   Email address internationalization provides for a much larger range of characters than many current validation algorithms allow , such as all Unicode characters above U + 0080 , encoded as UTF - 8 .   Identity validation ( edit )   Email addresses are the primary means of account activation ( user identification and validation on websites ) , but other methods are available , such as cell phone number validation , postal mail validation , fax validation . Email address validation is accomplished by the website sending an email to the user - provided email address with a special temporary hyperlink . On receipt , the user opens the link , immediately activating the account . Email addresses are also useful as means of forwarding messages from a website , e.g. , user messages , user actions , to the email inbox .   Internationalization ( edit )   The IETF conducts a technical and standards working group devoted to internationalization issues of email addresses , entitled Email Address Internationalization ( EAI , also known as IMA , Internationalized Mail Address ) . This group produced RFC 6530 , RFC 6531 , RFC 6532 , and RFC 6533 , and continues to work on additional EAI - related RFCs .   The IETF 's EAI Working group published RFC 6530 `` Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email '' , which enabled non-ASCII characters to be used in both the local - parts and domain of an email address . RFC 6530 provides for email based on the UTF - 8 encoding , which permits the full repertoire of Unicode . RFC 6531 provides a mechanism for SMTP servers to negotiate transmission of the SMTPUTF8 content .   The basic EAI concepts involve exchanging mail in UTF - 8 . Though the original proposal included a downgrading mechanism for legacy systems , this has now been dropped . The local servers are responsible for the local - part of the address , whereas the domain would be restricted by the rules of internationalized domain names , though still transmitted in UTF - 8 . The mail server is also responsible for any mapping mechanism between the IMA form and any ASCII alias .   EAI enables users to have a localized address in a native language script or character set , as well as an ASCII form for communicating with legacy systems or for script - independent use . Applications that recognize internationalized domain names and mail addresses must have facilities to convert these representations .   Significant demand for such addresses is expected in China , Japan , Russia , and other markets that have large user bases in a non-Latin - based writing system .   For example , in addition to the . in top - level domain , the government of India in 2011 got approval for ``. bharat '' , ( from Bhārat Gaṇarājya ) , written in seven different scripts for use by Gujrati , Marathi , Bangali , Tamil , Telugu , Punjabi and Urdu speakers . Indian company XgenPlus.com claims to be the world 's first EAI mailbox provider , and the Government of Rajasthan now supplies a free email account on domain राजस्थान. भारत for every citizen of the state . A leading media house Rajasthan Patrika launched their IDN domain पत्रिका. भारत with contactable email .   Internationalization examples ( edit )   The example addresses below would not be handled by RFC 5322 based servers , but are permitted by RFC 6530 . Servers compliant with this will be able to handle these :    Latin alphabet ( with diacritics ) : Pelé@example.com   Greek alphabet : δοκιμή @ παράδειγμα. δοκιμή   Traditional Chinese characters : 我 買 @ 屋 企. 香港   Japanese characters : 甲斐 @ 黒川. 日本   Cyrillic characters : чебурашка @ ящик - с - апельсинами. рф   Hindi email address : संपर्क @ डाटामेल. भारत    Internationalization support ( edit )    Postfix mailer supports internationalized mail since 2015 - 02 - 08 with a stable release 3.0. 0 .

       "     'document_text_clean': \"Email alias - wikipedia  Email alias  Jump to : navigation , search  An email alias is simply a forwarding email address . The term alias expansion is sometimes used to indicate a specific mode of email forwarding , thereby implying a more generic meaning of the term email alias as an address that is forwarded in a simplistic fashion .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Usage   2 Control issue   3 Abuse issue   4 See also   5 Notes      Usage ( edit )   Email aliases can be created on a mail server . The mail server simply forwards email messages addressed to an email alias on to another , the specified email address . An email alias may be used to create a simple replacement for a long or difficult - to - remember email address . It can also be used to create a generic email address such as webmaster@example.com and info@example.com .   On UNIX - like systems , email aliases may be placed into the file / etc / aliases and have the form :    local - alias - name : adifferentlocaluser , anotherlocaluser , an@external.user.example.com    Control issue ( edit )   Messages forwarded through an email alias retain the original SMTP envelope sender and recipient . If the message is a blind carbon copy , the recipient can only tell whether the message was forwarded through the alias by examining the message headers . However , the standard does not mandate mentioning the envelope recipient in the headers . Therefore , recipients of a message may not be able to recover what email address has been used by the sender to eventually deliver the message to their mailbox .   Recipients who can not trace what address the sender used are unable to ask the sender to stop sending , because the sender most likely will not be able to associate their current email address with the one used for sending . Even if users are able to learn the exact address used for sending , their mail client may not provide a convenient way to submit a reply using the latter as the sender address of the response . In other words , aliasing is not reversible . This is particularly relevant in opt - out situations where the sender does not provide a reliable mechanism in the body of the message . Typically , newsletters sent to undisclosed recipients can be sent submitting the body once along with a list of recipients , which is much less resource intensive than submitting a different body for each recipient . However , if VERP or BATV are being used ( e.g. to prevent email backscatter ) , the electronic mailing list software will send individual messages to each recipient with a different SMTP FROM address .   Abuse issue ( edit )   The recipient 's SMTP server sees only the forwarding system 's IP address . In general it has no reason to trust the Received : headerfield generated by the forwarding system and does not know the originating system 's IP address . Therefore , recipients can not reliably distinguish spam to the alias address from spam generated on the forwarding system . When a recipient reports a message to his ISP as spam , the ISP credits that spam to the forwarding system . ISPs with low abuse thresholds may begin blocking email from the forwarding system .   See also ( edit )    Email forwarding    Notes ( edit )    Jump up ^ RFC 5321 defines alias expansion as opposed to the list expansion of mailing lists , noting that the replacement of the address to whom bounce messages are returned makes a key difference . An email alias is different from a contact group , or distribution list . According to Microsoft , a contact group is `` a grouping of e-mail addresses collected under one name . A message sent to a contact group goes to all recipients listed in the group .

This screenshot shows the `` Inbox '' page of an email client , where users can see new emails and take actions , such as reading , deleting , saving , or responding to these messages The at sign , a part of every SMTP email address  Electronic mail ( email or e-mail ) is a method of exchanging messages ( `` mail '' ) between people using electronic devices . Email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email . Email operates across computer networks , which today is primarily the Internet . Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time , in common with instant messaging . Today 's email systems are based on a store - and - forward model . Email servers accept , forward , deliver , and store messages . Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously ; they need to connect only briefly , typically to a mail server or a webmail interface , for as long as it takes to send or receive messages .   Originally an ASCII text - only communications medium , Internet email was extended by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME ) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments . International email , with internationalized email addresses using UTF - 8 , has been standardized , but as of 2017 it has not been widely adopted .   The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early ARPANET , with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 ( RFC 561 ) . An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today . Email had an important role in creating the Internet , and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services .

For example , several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe fax document transmission . As a result , it is difficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more specific meaning it has today .   Electronic mail has been most commonly called email or e-mail since around 1993 , but variations of the spelling have been used :    email is the most common form used online , and is required by IETF Requests for Comments ( RFC ) and working groups and increasingly by style guides . This spelling also appears in most dictionaries .   e-mail is the format that sometimes appears in edited , published American English and British English writing as reflected in the Corpus of Contemporary American English data , but is falling out of favor in some style guides .   mail was the form used in the original protocol standard , RFC 524 . The service is referred to as mail , and a single piece of electronic mail is called a message .   EMail is a traditional form that has been used in RFCs for the `` Author 's Address '' and is expressly required `` for historical reasons '' .   E-mail is sometimes used , capitalizing the initial E as in similar abbreviations like E-piano , E-guitar , A-bomb , and H - bomb .    An Internet e-mail consists of an envelope and content ; the content in turn consists of a header and a body .   Origin ( edit )  Main article : History of email  Computer - based mail and messaging became possible with the advent of time - sharing computers in the early 1960s , and informal methods of using shared files to pass messages were soon expanded into the first mail systems . Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar , but generally incompatible , mail applications . Over time , a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them . Many US universities were part of the ARPANET ( created in the late 1960s ) , which aimed at software portability between its systems . That portability helped make the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) increasingly influential .   For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s , it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X. 400 email system , part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile ( GOSIP ) , would predominate . However , once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995 , a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP , POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard .   Operation ( edit )   The diagram to the right shows a typical sequence of events that takes place when sender Alice transmits a message using a mail user agent ( MUA ) addressed to the email address of the recipient .  Email operation   The MUA formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol , a profile of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) , to send the message content to the local mail submission agent ( MSA ) , in this case smtp.a.org .   The MSA determines the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol ( not from the message header ) , in this case bob@b.org . The part before the @ sign is the local part of the address , often the username of the recipient , and the part after the @ sign is a domain name . The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the mail server in the Domain Name System ( DNS ) .   The DNS server for the domain b.org ( ns.b.org ) responds with any MX records listing the mail exchange servers for that domain , in this case mx.b.org , a message transfer agent ( MTA ) server run by the recipient 's ISP .   smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP . This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final message delivery agent ( MDA ) .   The MDA delivers it to the mailbox of user bob .   Bob 's MUA picks up the message using either the Post Office Protocol ( POP3 ) or the Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) .    In addition to this example , alternatives and complications exist in the email system :    Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system , such as IBM Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange . These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor - specific , proprietary protocol . The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product 's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting . If Alice and Bob work for the same company , the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system .   Alice may not have a MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service .   Alice 's computer may run its own MTA , so avoiding the transfer at step 1 .   Bob may pick up his email in many ways , for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly , or by using a webmail service .   Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available .    Many MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them . Such MTAs are called open mail relays . This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable . However , this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare , and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays .   Message format ( edit )   The Internet email message format is now defined by RFC 5322 , with encoding of non-ASCII data and multimedia content attachments being defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049 , collectively called Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME . RFC 5322 replaced the earlier RFC 2822 in 2008 , and in turn RFC 2822 in 2001 replaced RFC 822 -- which had been the standard for Internet email for nearly 20 years . Published in 1982 , RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the ARPANET .   Internet email messages consist of two major sections , the message header and the message body , collectively known as content . The header is structured into fields such as From , To , CC , Subject , Date , and other information about the email . In the process of transporting email messages between systems , SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields . The body contains the message , as unstructured text , sometimes containing a signature block at the end . The header is separated from the body by a blank line .   Message header ( edit )   Each message has exactly one header , which is structured into fields . Each field has a name and a value . RFC 5322 specifies the precise syntax .   Informally , each line of text in the header that begins with a printable character begins a separate field . The field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character `` : '' . The separator is then followed by the field value ( the `` body '' of the field ) . The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character . Field names and values are restricted to 7 - bit ASCII characters . Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words .  Header fields ( edit )  Email header fields can be multi-line , and each line should be at most 78 characters long and in no event more than 998 characters long . Header fields defined by RFC 5322 can only contain US - ASCII characters ; for encoding characters in other sets , a syntax specified in RFC 2047 can be used . Recently the IETF EAI working group has defined some standards track extensions , replacing previous experimental extensions , to allow UTF - 8 encoded Unicode characters to be used within the header . In particular , this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters . Such addresses are supported by Google and Microsoft products , and promoted by some governments .   The message header must include at least the following fields :    From : The email address , and optionally the name of the author ( s ) . In many email clients not changeable except through changing account settings .   Date : The local time and date when the message was written . Like the From : field , many email clients fill this in automatically when sending . The recipient 's client may then display the time in the format and time zone local to them .    RFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the IANA ; it provides for permanent and provisional field names , including also fields defined for MIME , netnews , and HTTP , and referencing relevant RFCs . Common header fields for email include :    To : The email address ( es ) , and optionally name ( s ) of the message 's recipient ( s ) . Indicates primary recipients ( multiple allowed ) , for secondary recipients see Cc : and Bcc : below .   Subject : A brief summary of the topic of the message . Certain abbreviations are commonly used in the subject , including `` RE : '' and `` FW : '' .   Cc : Carbon copy ; Many email clients will mark email in one 's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To : or Cc : list . ( Bcc : Blind carbon copy ; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery , and not usually listed in the message header . )   Content - Type : Information about how the message is to be displayed , usually a MIME type .   Precedence : commonly with values `` bulk '' , `` junk '' , or `` list '' ; used to indicate that automated `` vacation '' or `` out of office '' responses should not be returned for this mail , e.g. to prevent vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list . Sendmail uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email , with `` Precedence : special - delivery '' messages delivered sooner . With modern high - bandwidth networks , delivery priority is less of an issue than it once was . Microsoft Exchange respects a fine - grained automatic response suppression mechanism , the X-Auto - Response - Suppress field .   Message - ID : Also an automatically generated field ; used to prevent multiple delivery and for reference in In - Reply - To : ( see below ) .   In - Reply - To : Message - ID of the message that this is a reply to . Used to link related messages together . This field only applies for reply messages .   References : Message - ID of the message that this is a reply to , and the message - id of the message the previous reply was a reply to , etc .   Reply - To : Address that should be used to reply to the message .   Sender : Address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From : field ( secretary , list manager , etc . ) .   Archived - At : A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message .    Note that the To : field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered . The actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol , SMTP , which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content . The `` To : '' field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope . In the same way , the `` From : '' field does not have to be the real sender of the email message . Some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages being relayed . Data pertaining to server 's activity is also part of the header , as defined below .   SMTP defines the trace information of a message , which is also saved in the header using the following two fields :    Received : when an SMTP server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header ( last to first ) .   Return - Path : when the delivery SMTP server makes the final delivery of a message , it inserts this field at the top of the header .    Other fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called trace fields , in a broader sense .    Authentication - Results : when a server carries out authentication checks , it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents .   Received - SPF : stores results of SPF checks in more detail than Authentication - Results .   Auto - Submitted : is used to mark automatically generated messages .   VBR - Info : claims VBR whitelisting    Message body ( edit )  Content encoding ( edit )  Internet email was originally designed for 7 - bit ASCII . Most email software is 8 - bit clean but must assume it will communicate with 7 - bit servers and mail readers . The MIME standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data : quoted printable for mostly 7 - bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data . The 8BITMIME and BINARY extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings , but many mail transport agents still do not support them fully . In some countries , several encoding schemes coexist ; as the result , by default , the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form ( the only exception is coincidence , when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme ) . Therefore , for international character sets , Unicode is growing in popularity .  Plain text and HTML ( edit )  Most modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or HTML for the message body at the option of the user . HTML email messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well , for compatibility reasons . Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in - line links and images , set apart previous messages in block quotes , wrap naturally on any display , use emphasis such as underlines and italics , and change font styles . Disadvantages include the increased size of the email , privacy concerns about web bugs , abuse of HTML email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software .   Some web - based mailing lists recommend that all posts be made in plain - text , with 72 or 80 characters per line for all the above reasons , but also because they have a significant number of readers using text - based email clients such as Mutt . Some Microsoft email clients allow rich formatting using their proprietary Rich Text Format ( RTF ) , but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible email client .   Servers and client applications ( edit )  The interface of an email client , Thunderbird .  Messages are exchanged between hosts using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol with software programs called mail transfer agents ( MTAs ) ; and delivered to a mail store by programs called mail delivery agents ( MDAs , also sometimes called local delivery agents , LDAs ) . Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it , and when a message can not be delivered , that MTA must send a bounce message back to the sender , indicating the problem .   Users can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as POP or IMAP , or , as is more likely in a large corporate environment , with a proprietary protocol specific to Novell Groupwise , Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange Servers . Programs used by users for retrieving , reading , and managing email are called mail user agents ( MUAs ) .   Mail can be stored on the client , on the server side , or in both places . Standard formats for mailboxes include Maildir and mbox . Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them . Server - side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as IMAP , moving email from one server to another can be done with any MUA supporting the protocol .   Many current email users do not run MTA , MDA or MUA programs themselves , but use a web - based email platform , such as Gmail , Hotmail , or Yahoo ! Mail , that performs the same tasks . Such webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard web browser , from any computer , rather than relying on an email client .   Filename extensions ( edit )   Upon reception of email messages , email client applications save messages in operating system files in the file system . Some clients save individual messages as separate files , while others use various database formats , often proprietary , for collective storage . A historical standard of storage is the mbox format . The specific format used is often indicated by special filename extensions :    eml   Used by many email clients including Novell GroupWise , Microsoft Outlook Express , Lotus notes , Windows Mail , Mozilla Thunderbird , and Postbox . The files contain the email contents as plain text in MIME format , containing the email header and body , including attachments in one or more of several formats .   emlx   Used by Apple Mail .   msg   Used by Microsoft Office Outlook and OfficeLogic Groupware .   mbx   Used by Opera Mail , KMail , and Apple Mail based on the mbox format .    Some applications ( like Apple Mail ) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments . Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory .   URI scheme mailto ( edit )  Main article : mailto  The URI scheme , as registered with the IANA , defines the mailto : scheme for SMTP email addresses . Though its use is not strictly defined , URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user 's mail client when the URL is activated , with the address as defined by the URL in the To : field .   Types ( edit )   Web - based email ( edit )  Main article : Webmail  Many email providers have a web - based email client ( e.g. AOL Mail , Gmail , Outlook.com , Hotmail and Yahoo ! Mail ) . This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible web browser to send and receive their email . Mail is typically not downloaded to the client , so ca n't be read without a current Internet connection .   POP3 email services ( edit )   The Post Office Protocol 3 ( POP3 ) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server . Received messages are often deleted from the server . POP supports simple download - and - delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes ( termed maildrop in the POP RFC 's ) .   IMAP email servers ( edit )   The Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices . Small portable devices like smartphones are increasingly used to check email while travelling , and to make brief replies , larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length . IMAP shows the headers of messages , the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages . Usually mail is left in folders in the mail server .   MAPI email servers ( edit )   Messaging Application Programming Interface ( MAPI ) is used by Microsoft Outlook to communicate to Microsoft Exchange Server - and to a range of other email server products such as Axigen Mail Server , Kerio Connect , Scalix , Zimbra , HP OpenMail , IBM Lotus Notes , Zarafa , and Bynari where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook .

( November 2007 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Business and organizational use ( edit )   Email has been widely accepted by business , governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world , and it is one of the key parts of an ' e-revolution ' in workplace communication ( with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed Internet ) . A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83 % of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work .   It has some key benefits to business and other organizations , including :    Facilitating logistics   Much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building , area , or even country ; setting up and attending an in - person meeting , telephone call , or conference call can be inconvenient , time - consuming , and costly . Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set - up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call .   Helping with synchronisation   With real time communication by meetings or phone calls , participants must work on the same schedule , and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call . Email allows asynchrony : each participant may control their schedule independently .   Reducing cost   Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail , or long distance telephone calls , telex or telegrams .   Increasing speed   Much faster than most of the alternatives .   Creating a `` written '' record   Unlike a telephone or in - person conversation , email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication , the identity of the sender ( s ) and recipient ( s ) and the date and time the message was sent . In the event of a contract or legal dispute , saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues , as each email has the date and time recorded on it .   Email marketing ( edit )  Email marketing via `` opt - in '' is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information . Depending on the recipient 's culture , email sent without permission -- such as an `` opt - in '' -- is likely to be viewed as unwelcome `` email spam '' .   Personal use ( edit )  Personal computer ( edit )  Many users access their personal email from friends and family members using a personal computer in their house or apartment .  Mobile ( edit )  Email has become used on smartphones and on all types of computers . Mobile `` apps '' for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their home . While in the earliest years of email , users could only access email on desktop computers , in the 2010s , it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home , whether they are across town or across the world . Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other device to notify them immediately of new messages . This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day . As of 2011 , there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily .   Individuals often check email on smartphones for both personal and work - related messages . It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their Facebook accounts , making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones . 78 % of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone . It was also found that 30 % of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email , and 91 % were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone . However , the percentage of consumers using email on smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries . For example , in comparison to 75 % of those consumers in the US who used it , only 17 % in India did .  Declining use among Young people ( edit )  As of 2010 , the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009 . For persons 12 to 17 , the number was down 18 percent . Young people preferred instant messaging , texting and social media , and email was not designed for them anyway . Technology writer Matt Richtel said in The New York Times that email was like the VCR , vinyl records and film cameras -- no longer cool and something older people do .   A 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45 , and were far less likely to use email .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( October 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Attachment size limitation ( edit )  Main article : Email attachment  Email messages may have one or more attachments , which are additional files that are appended to the email . Typical attachments include Microsoft Word documents , pdf documents and scanned images of paper documents . In principle there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments , but in practice email clients , servers and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files , or complete email - typically to 25MB or less . Furthermore , due to technical reasons , attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ to what the user sees , which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email . Where larger files need to be shared , file hosting services of various sorts are available ; and generally suggested . Some large files , such as digital photos , color presentations and video or music files are too large for some email systems .   Information overload ( edit )   The ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and `` white collar '' employees has led to concerns that recipients face an `` information overload '' in dealing with increasing volumes of email . With the growth in mobile devices , by default employees may also receive work - related emails outside of their working day . This can lead to increased stress , decreased satisfaction with work , and some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect , as efforts to read the many emails could reduce productivity .   Spam ( edit )  Main article : Email spam  Email `` spam '' is the term used to describe unsolicited bulk email . The low cost of sending such email meant that by 2003 up to 30 % of total email traffic was already spam. and was threatening the usefulness of email as a practical tool . The US CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws elsewhere had some impact , and a number of effective anti-spam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users , but the volume sent is still very high -- and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products , but malicious content or links .   Malware ( edit )   A range of malicious email types exist . These range from various types of email scams , including `` social engineering '' scams such as advance - fee scam `` Nigerian letters '' , to phishing , email bombardment and email worms .   Email spoofing ( edit )  Main article : Email spoofing  Email spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source . Email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin . Email spoofing may be done as a prank , or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization . An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email which appears to be an invoice from a major company , and then sends it to one or more recipients . In some cases , these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate .   Email bombing ( edit )  Main article : Email bomb  Email bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address . The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash .   Privacy concerns ( edit )  Main article : Email privacy  Today it can be important to distinguish between Internet and internal email systems . Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender 's or the recipient 's control . During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content . Internal mail systems , in which the information never leaves the organizational network , may be more secure , although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees .   Email privacy , without some security precautions , can be compromised because :    email messages are generally not encrypted .   email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination , meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages .   many Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered . The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server , despite deletion from the mailbox .   the `` Received : '' - fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender , preventing anonymous communication .   web bugs invisibly embedded in email content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is read , or re-read , and from which IP address . It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC , or Apple Mac device via the user agent string .    There are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above . For example , Virtual Private Networks or the Tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG , PGP , SMEmail , or S / MIME can be used for end - to - end message encryption , and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server .   Additionally , many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords , making them easy to intercept by an attacker . Encrypted authentication schemes such as SASL prevent this . Finally , attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peer - to - peer filesharing . Attached files may contain trojans or viruses .   Flaming ( edit )   Flaming occurs when a person sends a message ( or many messages ) with angry or antagonistic content . The term is derived from the use of the word `` incendiary '' to describe particularly heated email discussions . The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten .   Email bankruptcy ( edit )  Main article : Email bankruptcy  Also known as `` email fatigue '' , email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them . The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all . As a solution , people occasionally send a `` boilerplate '' message explaining that their email inbox is full , and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages . Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig is credited with coining this term , but he may only have popularized it .   Internationalization ( edit )   Originally Internet email was completely ASCII text - based . MIME now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets , but other headers and email addresses using UTF - 8 , while standardized have yet to be widely adopted .  Further information : International email and Email address § Internationalization  Tracking of sent mail ( edit )   The original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message , and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read . It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice ( bounce message ) , but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost . To remedy this , the IETF introduced Delivery Status Notifications ( delivery receipts ) and Message Disposition Notifications ( return receipts ) ; however , these are not universally deployed in production . ( A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined , but it never gained traction ; see RFCs 3885 through 3888 . )   Many ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports ( NDRs ) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers :    Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so , this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed .   If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ( email spoofing ) , then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail . These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user .    In the absence of standard methods , a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed . However , these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns , and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML . Many mail clients now default to not showing `` web content '' . Webmail providers can also disrupt web bugs by pre-caching images .

For the former manufacturing conglomerate , see Email Limited . `` Inbox '' redirects here . For the Google product , see Inbox by Gmail . This screenshot shows the `` Inbox '' page of an email client , where users can see new emails and take actions , such as reading , deleting , saving , or responding to these messages The at sign , a part of every SMTP email address  Electronic mail ( email or e-mail ) is a method of exchanging messages ( `` mail '' ) between people using electronic devices . Invented by Ray Tomlinson , email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email . Email operates across computer networks , which today is primarily the Internet . Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time , in common with instant messaging . Today 's email systems are based on a store - and - forward model . Email servers accept , forward , deliver , and store messages . Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously ; they need to connect only briefly , typically to a mail server or a webmail interface , for as long as it takes to send or receive messages .   Originally an ASCII text - only communications medium , Internet email was extended by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME ) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments . International email , with internationalized email addresses using UTF - 8 , has been standardized , but as of 2017 it has not been widely adopted .   The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early ARPANET , with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 ( RFC 561 ) . An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today . Email had an important role in creating the Internet , and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services .

For example , several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe fax document transmission . As a result , it is difficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more specific meaning it has today .   Electronic mail has been most commonly called email or e-mail since around 1993 , but variations of the spelling have been used :    email is the most common form used online , and is required by IETF Requests for Comments ( RFC ) and working groups and increasingly by style guides . This spelling also appears in most dictionaries .   e-mail is the format that sometimes appears in edited , published American English and British English writing as reflected in the Corpus of Contemporary American English data , but is falling out of favor in some style guides .   mail was the form used in the original protocol standard , RFC 524 . The service is referred to as mail , and a single piece of electronic mail is called a message .   EMail is a traditional form that has been used in RFCs for the `` Author 's Address '' and is expressly required `` for historical reasons '' .   E-mail is sometimes used , capitalizing the initial E as in similar abbreviations like E-piano , E-guitar , A-bomb , and H - bomb .    An Internet e-mail consists of an envelope and content ; the content in turn consists of a header and a body .   Origin ( edit )  Main article : History of email  Computer - based mail and messaging became possible with the advent of time - sharing computers in the early 1960s , and informal methods of using shared files to pass messages were soon expanded into the first mail systems . Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar , but generally incompatible , mail applications . Over time , a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them . Many US universities were part of the ARPANET ( created in the late 1960s ) , which aimed at software portability between its systems . That portability helped make the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) increasingly influential .   For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s , it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X. 400 email system , part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile ( GOSIP ) , would predominate . However , once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995 , a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP , POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard .   Operation ( edit )   The diagram to the right shows a typical sequence of events that takes place when sender Alice transmits a message using a mail user agent ( MUA ) addressed to the email address of the recipient .  Email operation   The MUA formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol , a profile of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) , to send the message content to the local mail submission agent ( MSA ) , in this case smtp.a.org .   The MSA determines the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol ( not from the message header ) , in this case bob@b.org . The part before the @ sign is the local part of the address , often the username of the recipient , and the part after the @ sign is a domain name . The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the mail server in the Domain Name System ( DNS ) .   The DNS server for the domain b.org ( ns.b.org ) responds with any MX records listing the mail exchange servers for that domain , in this case mx.b.org , a message transfer agent ( MTA ) server run by the recipient 's ISP .   smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP . This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final message delivery agent ( MDA ) .   The MDA delivers it to the mailbox of user bob .   Bob 's MUA picks up the message using either the Post Office Protocol ( POP3 ) or the Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) .    In addition to this example , alternatives and complications exist in the email system :    Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system , such as IBM Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange . These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor - specific , proprietary protocol . The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product 's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting . If Alice and Bob work for the same company , the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system .   Alice may not have a MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service .   Alice 's computer may run its own MTA , so avoiding the transfer at step 1 .   Bob may pick up his email in many ways , for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly , or by using a webmail service .   Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available .    Many MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them . Such MTAs are called open mail relays . This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable . However , this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare , and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays .   Message format ( edit )   The Internet email message format is now defined by RFC 5322 , with encoding of non-ASCII data and multimedia content attachments being defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049 , collectively called Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME . RFC 5322 replaced the earlier RFC 2822 in 2008 , and in turn RFC 2822 in 2001 replaced RFC 822 -- which had been the standard for Internet email for nearly 20 years . Published in 1982 , RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the ARPANET .   Internet email messages consist of two major sections , the message header and the message body , collectively known as content . The header is structured into fields such as From , To , CC , Subject , Date , and other information about the email . In the process of transporting email messages between systems , SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields . The body contains the message , as unstructured text , sometimes containing a signature block at the end . The header is separated from the body by a blank line .   Message header ( edit )   Each message has exactly one header , which is structured into fields . Each field has a name and a value . RFC 5322 specifies the precise syntax .   Informally , each line of text in the header that begins with a printable character begins a separate field . The field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character `` : '' . The separator is then followed by the field value ( the `` body '' of the field ) . The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character . Field names and values are restricted to 7 - bit ASCII characters . Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words .  Header fields ( edit )  Email header fields can be multi-line , and each line should be at most 78 characters long and in no event more than 998 characters long . Header fields defined by RFC 5322 can only contain US - ASCII characters ; for encoding characters in other sets , a syntax specified in RFC 2047 can be used . Recently the IETF EAI working group has defined some standards track extensions , replacing previous experimental extensions , to allow UTF - 8 encoded Unicode characters to be used within the header . In particular , this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters . Such addresses are supported by Google and Microsoft products , and promoted by some governments .   The message header must include at least the following fields :    From : The email address , and optionally the name of the author ( s ) . In many email clients not changeable except through changing account settings .   Date : The local time and date when the message was written . Like the From : field , many email clients fill this in automatically when sending . The recipient 's client may then display the time in the format and time zone local to them .    RFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the IANA ; it provides for permanent and provisional field names , including also fields defined for MIME , netnews , and HTTP , and referencing relevant RFCs . Common header fields for email include :    To : The email address ( es ) , and optionally name ( s ) of the message 's recipient ( s ) . Indicates primary recipients ( multiple allowed ) , for secondary recipients see Cc : and Bcc : below .   Subject : A brief summary of the topic of the message . Certain abbreviations are commonly used in the subject , including `` RE : '' and `` FW : '' .   Cc : Carbon copy ; Many email clients will mark email in one 's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To : or Cc : list . ( Bcc : Blind carbon copy ; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery , and not usually listed in the message header . )   Content - Type : Information about how the message is to be displayed , usually a MIME type .   Precedence : commonly with values `` bulk '' , `` junk '' , or `` list '' ; used to indicate that automated `` vacation '' or `` out of office '' responses should not be returned for this mail , e.g. to prevent vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list . Sendmail uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email , with `` Precedence : special - delivery '' messages delivered sooner . With modern high - bandwidth networks , delivery priority is less of an issue than it once was . Microsoft Exchange respects a fine - grained automatic response suppression mechanism , the X-Auto - Response - Suppress field .   Message - ID : Also an automatically generated field ; used to prevent multiple delivery and for reference in In - Reply - To : ( see below ) .   In - Reply - To : Message - ID of the message that this is a reply to . Used to link related messages together . This field only applies for reply messages .   References : Message - ID of the message that this is a reply to , and the message - id of the message the previous reply was a reply to , etc .   Reply - To : Address that should be used to reply to the message .   Sender : Address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From : field ( secretary , list manager , etc . ) .   Archived - At : A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message .    Note that the To : field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered . The actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol , SMTP , which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content . The `` To : '' field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope . In the same way , the `` From : '' field does not have to be the real sender of the email message . Some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages being relayed . Data pertaining to server 's activity is also part of the header , as defined below .   SMTP defines the trace information of a message , which is also saved in the header using the following two fields :    Received : when an SMTP server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header ( last to first ) .   Return - Path : when the delivery SMTP server makes the final delivery of a message , it inserts this field at the top of the header .    Other fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called trace fields , in a broader sense .    Authentication - Results : when a server carries out authentication checks , it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents .   Received - SPF : stores results of SPF checks in more detail than Authentication - Results .   Auto - Submitted : is used to mark automatically generated messages .   VBR - Info : claims VBR whitelisting    Message body ( edit )  Content encoding ( edit )  Internet email was originally designed for 7 - bit ASCII . Most email software is 8 - bit clean but must assume it will communicate with 7 - bit servers and mail readers . The MIME standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data : quoted printable for mostly 7 - bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data . The 8BITMIME and BINARY extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings , but many mail transport agents still do not support them fully . In some countries , several encoding schemes coexist ; as the result , by default , the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form ( the only exception is coincidence , when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme ) . Therefore , for international character sets , Unicode is growing in popularity .  Plain text and HTML ( edit )  Most modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or HTML for the message body at the option of the user . HTML email messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well , for compatibility reasons . Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in - line links and images , set apart previous messages in block quotes , wrap naturally on any display , use emphasis such as underlines and italics , and change font styles . Disadvantages include the increased size of the email , privacy concerns about web bugs , abuse of HTML email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software .   Some web - based mailing lists recommend that all posts be made in plain - text , with 72 or 80 characters per line for all the above reasons , but also because they have a significant number of readers using text - based email clients such as Mutt . Some Microsoft email clients allow rich formatting using their proprietary Rich Text Format ( RTF ) , but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible email client .   Servers and client applications ( edit )  The interface of an email client , Thunderbird .  Messages are exchanged between hosts using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol with software programs called mail transfer agents ( MTAs ) ; and delivered to a mail store by programs called mail delivery agents ( MDAs , also sometimes called local delivery agents , LDAs ) . Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it , and when a message can not be delivered , that MTA must send a bounce message back to the sender , indicating the problem .   Users can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as POP or IMAP , or , as is more likely in a large corporate environment , with a proprietary protocol specific to Novell Groupwise , Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange Servers . Programs used by users for retrieving , reading , and managing email are called mail user agents ( MUAs ) .   Mail can be stored on the client , on the server side , or in both places . Standard formats for mailboxes include Maildir and mbox . Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them . Server - side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as IMAP , moving email from one server to another can be done with any MUA supporting the protocol .   Many current email users do not run MTA , MDA or MUA programs themselves , but use a web - based email platform , such as Gmail , Hotmail , or Yahoo ! Mail , that performs the same tasks . Such webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard web browser , from any computer , rather than relying on an email client .   Filename extensions ( edit )   Upon reception of email messages , email client applications save messages in operating system files in the file system . Some clients save individual messages as separate files , while others use various database formats , often proprietary , for collective storage . A historical standard of storage is the mbox format . The specific format used is often indicated by special filename extensions :    eml   Used by many email clients including Novell GroupWise , Microsoft Outlook Express , Lotus notes , Windows Mail , Mozilla Thunderbird , and Postbox . The files contain the email contents as plain text in MIME format , containing the email header and body , including attachments in one or more of several formats .   emlx   Used by Apple Mail .   msg   Used by Microsoft Office Outlook and OfficeLogic Groupware .   mbx   Used by Opera Mail , KMail , and Apple Mail based on the mbox format .    Some applications ( like Apple Mail ) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments . Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory .   URI scheme mailto ( edit )  Main article : mailto  The URI scheme , as registered with the IANA , defines the mailto : scheme for SMTP email addresses . Though its use is not strictly defined , URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user 's mail client when the URL is activated , with the address as defined by the URL in the To : field .   Types ( edit )   Web - based email ( edit )  Main article : Webmail  Many email providers have a web - based email client ( e.g. AOL Mail , Gmail , Outlook.com , Hotmail and Yahoo ! Mail ) . This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible web browser to send and receive their email . Mail is typically not downloaded to the client , so ca n't be read without a current Internet connection .   POP3 email services ( edit )   The Post Office Protocol 3 ( POP3 ) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server . Received messages are often deleted from the server . POP supports simple download - and - delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes ( termed maildrop in the POP RFC 's ) .   IMAP email servers ( edit )   The Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices . Small portable devices like smartphones are increasingly used to check email while travelling , and to make brief replies , larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length . IMAP shows the headers of messages , the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages . Usually mail is left in folders in the mail server .   MAPI email servers ( edit )   Messaging Application Programming Interface ( MAPI ) is used by Microsoft Outlook to communicate to Microsoft Exchange Server - and to a range of other email server products such as Axigen Mail Server , Kerio Connect , Scalix , Zimbra , HP OpenMail , IBM Lotus Notes , Zarafa , and Bynari where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook .

( November 2007 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Business and organizational use ( edit )   Email has been widely accepted by business , governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world , and it is one of the key parts of an ' e-revolution ' in workplace communication ( with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed Internet ) . A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83 % of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work .   It has some key benefits to business and other organizations , including :    Facilitating logistics   Much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building , area , or even country ; setting up and attending an in - person meeting , telephone call , or conference call can be inconvenient , time - consuming , and costly . Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set - up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call .   Helping with synchronisation   With real time communication by meetings or phone calls , participants must work on the same schedule , and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call . Email allows asynchrony : each participant may control their schedule independently .   Reducing cost   Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail , or long distance telephone calls , telex or telegrams .   Increasing speed   Much faster than most of the alternatives .   Creating a `` written '' record   Unlike a telephone or in - person conversation , email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication , the identity of the sender ( s ) and recipient ( s ) and the date and time the message was sent . In the event of a contract or legal dispute , saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues , as each email has the date and time recorded on it .   Email marketing ( edit )  Email marketing via `` opt - in '' is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information . Depending on the recipient 's culture , email sent without permission -- such as an `` opt - in '' -- is likely to be viewed as unwelcome `` email spam '' .   Personal use ( edit )  Personal computer ( edit )  Many users access their personal email from friends and family members using a personal computer in their house or apartment .  Mobile ( edit )  Email has become used on smartphones and on all types of computers . Mobile `` apps '' for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their home . While in the earliest years of email , users could only access email on desktop computers , in the 2010s , it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home , whether they are across town or across the world . Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other device to notify them immediately of new messages . This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day . As of 2011 , there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily .   Individuals often check email on smartphones for both personal and work - related messages . It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their Facebook accounts , making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones . 78 % of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone . It was also found that 30 % of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email , and 91 % were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone . However , the percentage of consumers using email on smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries . For example , in comparison to 75 % of those consumers in the US who used it , only 17 % in India did .  Declining use among Young people ( edit )  As of 2010 , the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009 . For persons 12 to 17 , the number was down 18 percent . Young people preferred instant messaging , texting and social media . Technology writer Matt Richtel said in The New York Times that email was like the VCR , vinyl records and film cameras -- no longer cool and something older people do .   A 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45 , and were far less likely to use email .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( October 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Attachment size limitation ( edit )  Main article : Email attachment  Email messages may have one or more attachments , which are additional files that are appended to the email . Typical attachments include Microsoft Word documents , pdf documents and scanned images of paper documents . In principle there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments , but in practice email clients , servers and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files , or complete email - typically to 25MB or less . Furthermore , due to technical reasons , attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ to what the user sees , which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email . Where larger files need to be shared , file hosting services of various sorts are available ; and generally suggested . Some large files , such as digital photos , color presentations and video or music files are too large for some email systems .   Information overload ( edit )   The ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and `` white collar '' employees has led to concerns that recipients face an `` information overload '' in dealing with increasing volumes of email . With the growth in mobile devices , by default employees may also receive work - related emails outside of their working day . This can lead to increased stress , decreased satisfaction with work , and some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect , as efforts to read the many emails could reduce productivity .   Spam ( edit )  Main article : Email spam  Email `` spam '' is the term used to describe unsolicited bulk email . The low cost of sending such email meant that by 2003 up to 30 % of total email traffic was already spam. and was threatening the usefulness of email as a practical tool . The US CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws elsewhere had some impact , and a number of effective anti-spam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users , but the volume sent is still very high -- and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products , but malicious content or links .   Malware ( edit )   A range of malicious email types exist . These range from various types of email scams , including `` social engineering '' scams such as advance - fee scam `` Nigerian letters '' , to phishing , email bombardment and email worms .   Email spoofing ( edit )  Main article : Email spoofing  Email spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source . Email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin . Email spoofing may be done as a prank , or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization . An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email which appears to be an invoice from a major company , and then sends it to one or more recipients . In some cases , these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate .   Email bombing ( edit )  Main article : Email bomb  Email bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address . The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash .   Privacy concerns ( edit )  Main article : Email privacy  Today it can be important to distinguish between Internet and internal email systems . Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender 's or the recipient 's control . During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content . Internal mail systems , in which the information never leaves the organizational network , may be more secure , although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees .   Email privacy , without some security precautions , can be compromised because :    email messages are generally not encrypted .   email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination , meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages .   many Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered . The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server , despite deletion from the mailbox .   the `` Received : '' - fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender , preventing anonymous communication .   web bugs invisibly embedded in email content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is read , or re-read , and from which IP address . It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC , or Apple Mac device via the user agent string .    There are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above . For example , Virtual Private Networks or the Tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG , PGP , SMEmail , or S / MIME can be used for end - to - end message encryption , and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server .   Additionally , many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords , making them easy to intercept by an attacker . Encrypted authentication schemes such as SASL prevent this . Finally , attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peer - to - peer filesharing . Attached files may contain trojans or viruses .   Flaming ( edit )   Flaming occurs when a person sends a message ( or many messages ) with angry or antagonistic content . The term is derived from the use of the word `` incendiary '' to describe particularly heated email discussions . The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten .   Email bankruptcy ( edit )  Main article : Email bankruptcy  Also known as `` email fatigue '' , email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them . The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all . As a solution , people occasionally send a `` boilerplate '' message explaining that their email inbox is full , and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages . Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig is credited with coining this term , but he may only have popularized it .   Internationalization ( edit )   Originally Internet email was completely ASCII text - based . MIME now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets , but other headers and email addresses using UTF - 8 , while standardized have yet to be widely adopted .  Further information : International email and Email address § Internationalization  Tracking of sent mail ( edit )   The original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message , and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read . It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice ( bounce message ) , but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost . To remedy this , the IETF introduced Delivery Status Notifications ( delivery receipts ) and Message Disposition Notifications ( return receipts ) ; however , these are not universally deployed in production . ( A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined , but it never gained traction ; see RFCs 3885 through 3888 . )   Many ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports ( NDRs ) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers :    Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so , this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed .   If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ( email spoofing ) , then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail . These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user .    In the absence of standard methods , a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed . However , these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns , and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML . Many mail clients now default to not showing `` web content '' . Webmail providers can also disrupt web bugs by pre-caching images .
