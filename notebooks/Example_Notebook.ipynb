Lily is portrayed by American actress Alyson Hannigan . She is the wife of Marshall Eriksen and the best friend of Ted Mosby , Robin Scherbatsky and Barney Stinson . Lily is a kindergarten teacher and an amateur painter . In the eighth season , she gets a job as an art consultant . Lily is also the only member of the original main cast of the series who has not appeared in every episode , due to Alyson Hannigan taking leave after giving birth to her first child .     Contents  ( hide )   1 Casting   2 Character overview   3 Character history   4 Reception   5 References      Casting ( edit )   Series creator Craig Thomas explained that he based Marshall and Lily on himself and his wife Rebecca . Rebecca had been upset after learning this , but ( as she is a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) was consoled when Alyson Hannigan was put in the role . Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work after having worked on the American Pie series and was available for the show .   Character overview ( edit )   Lily Aldrin , born March 22 , 1978 , grew up in Park Slope , Brooklyn , New York . She is the daughter of Janice Aldrin , whom Lily describes as a feminist and who worked two jobs to support the family . The creators stated in commentary that there is no evidence to the contrary that Lily 's grandfather is astronaut Buzz Aldrin -- and like Buzz Aldrin , her grandfather is said to have fought in the Korean War . Lily 's father , Mickey , is an unsuccessful board game creator living in his parents ' basement . Janice and Mickey divorced when Lily was a child . Lily is estranged from her father -- an absentee parent who she claims `` broke my heart every day for 20 years '' -- until he promises to be there for her following the birth of her son .   During her high school and college years , she was a part of the goth subculture , dying her hair and wearing stereotypical `` goth '' clothes . She dumped her high school boyfriend , Scooter , on prom night , admitting she only dated him because he looked like Kurt Cobain . He remains obsessed with her for years afterward . She met Marshall during her freshman year at Wesleyan University in 1996 and dated him throughout college .   As of 2010 , Lily is 32 years old , meaning she was born circa 1978 . According to her résumé , she is fluent in Italian , certified in teaching English as a Second Language , and proficient in Photoshop , Quark , and Java .   Lily frequently states her need for regular sex , saying that if she went without for too long she 'd be `` out there selling it for a nickel '' . She has a more than passing sexual interest in other women , suggesting she may be bisexual . In particular , she has confessed several times , albeit in a seemingly joking fashion , that she finds Robin sexually attractive , and has been the subject of some sexually `` confusing dreams '' . Robin at one point says that she wo n't go near Lily after she 's been drinking martinis , as she is prone to flirt quite strongly with her and even try to get the guys to dare them to make out . Well aware of Lily 's sexual attraction to her , Robin tends to alternate between ignoring , and being disturbed by them whenever they show themselves .   Lily is adept at manipulating people and situations to get what she wants ; she is especially talented at engineering breakups between couples she knows are not right for each other . Barney calls her a `` diabolical puppet master '' and `` pure evil '' , while Ted calls her a `` psychopath '' .   Character history ( edit )   Lily and Marshall get engaged in the fall of 2005 , as portrayed in the series pilot . Towards the end of the first season , she reveals to Robin that she has been having second thoughts about getting married without having experienced much else of life before Marshall . Those doubts intensify , and she acts upon them , applying for a painting fellowship in San Francisco . She is accepted and , after arguing with Marshall on and off -- with several pause breaks in between for drinks , dinner at Red Lobster , and sex -- Lily finally says that she can not promise Marshall that she would return to him after the three - month fellowship . They break up , and she goes to San Francisco .   She returns to New York three months later , and confesses that leaving had been a mistake . She begs Marshall to take her back , but Marshall ca n't get over his wounded pride , and refuses . They eventually get back together , however , and resume their engagement . They finally get married at the end of the season .   In the third season , it is revealed that Lily is a shopaholic , and goes shopping whenever something bad happens . She keeps her multiple credit cards in a `` box of shame '' . She and Marshall struggle with her credit card bills , especially when they were about to buy an apartment , which leaves Marshall no choice but to abandon his dreams of being an environmental lawyer and take a job at a big corporate firm . They eventually get the house , only to find out that the neighborhood is situated near a water sewage treatment plant and that the floor of their apartment is crooked .   Lily , along with Ted and Marshall , occasionally indulge in `` sandwiches '' ( Future Ted 's euphemism for marijuana ) during college and at their 20th college reunion .   Out of all of the characters , she is the only one Barney chooses to confide in when he realizes that he is in love with Robin . In the fifth season , Lily forces Robin and Barney to confess to being a couple . She does this by detaching the doorknob of Robin 's room at the apartment and waits for them to have `` the talk '' . Robin and Barney pass a few notes under the door with vague explanations , none of which satisfy her . To convince Lily to let them out , they lie about being boyfriend and girlfriend , but after they leave the apartment hand - in - hand , Lily tells Ted `` they did n't realize they were n't lying . ''   Lily and Marshall are both ecstatic to have another couple to hang out with . They invite Robin and Barney for an evening together , which goes awry ; Lily and Marshall become clingy and dependent , prompting Barney and Robin to `` break up '' with them . Eventually , Barney and Robin realize they miss Lily and Marshall , and they all profess their desire to be a foursome . When Barney and Robin 's relationship starts to falter , Lily `` coming out of retirement '' to break them up . She executes an elaborate plan to get them into a big argument ; this fails , but they finally realize they do n't work as a couple .   The group discovers that Lily has a doppelgänger named Jasmine , a Russian stripper . Lily is especially excited about this , and is so enthralled by her stripper twin that she and Marshall get a private dance . At the end of the night , Lily switches place with Jasmine and dances with much difficulty on stage , eventually falling into the crowd , to Marshall 's horror .   Throughout the sixth season , Marshall and Lily try to get pregnant . Their first attempts are unsuccessful , however , and they worry that they will not be able to conceive . In the season finale , Lily finally gets pregnant . At the end of the seventh season , she gives birth to a son , Marvin .   In the eighth season , Lily takes a job as an art consultant to a millionaire called `` The Captain '' , who eventually offers to move her to Italy . She turns the promotion down , however , as it conflicts with Marshall 's job as an environmental lawyer . Marshall convinces her to take it , however , and the two prepare to move to Rome . In the season finale , Marshall accepts a judgeship without telling her , putting her plans in jeopardy .   During the final season , set during the weekend of Barney and Robin 's wedding , Lily learns of Marshall 's new job , and they get into a huge fight . She storms out , but returns and reconciles with Marshall upon learning that she is pregnant . Marshall turns the job down , and agrees to go to Italy with her . A flash forward scene reveals that Lily gives birth to a girl , Daisy .   On the day of the wedding , Lily and Marshall renew their vows to each other .   The series finale , `` Last Forever '' , reveals that , a few years later , Lily gives birth to a third child , a baby girl whose name is unknown . Even as the group drifts apart over the years , Lily is there for all the important moments of their lives : Robin and Barney 's divorce , the birth of Barney 's daughter and that of Ted 's two children , and Ted 's wedding to The Mother ( whose real name is Tracy McConnell ) . She remains happily married to Marshall , who eventually becomes a State Supreme Court judge .

As a framing device , Ted , in the year 2030 , recounts to his son and daughter the events that led him to meet their mother .   The series was created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays , who also served as the show 's executive producers and were frequent writers . The series was loosely inspired by their friendship when they both lived in New York City . Among the 208 episodes , there were only four directors : Pamela Fryman ( 196 episodes ) , Rob Greenberg ( 7 episodes ) , Michael Shea ( 4 episodes ) and Neil Patrick Harris ( 1 episode ) .   Known for its unique structure , humor , and incorporation of dramatic elements , How I Met Your Mother has gained a cult following over the years . The show initially received positive reviews , while the later seasons received more mixed reviews . The show was nominated for 30 Emmy Awards , winning ten . In 2010 , Alyson Hannigan won the People 's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress . In 2012 , seven years after its premiere , the series won the People 's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy , and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor .   The ninth and final season began airing on September 23 , 2013 , and concluded on March 31 , 2014 , with a double - length finale episode , which received polarized reviews from critics and fans alike for its controversial twist ending , as many critics and fans believed it contradicted many of the previous episodes .

The story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with a 27 - year - old Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect ; the narrative deals primarily with his best friends , including the long - lasting couple Marshall Eriksen ( Jason Segel ) and Lily Aldrin ( Alyson Hannigan ) , womanizing - playboy Barney Stinson ( Neil Patrick Harris ) , and news reporter Robin Scherbatsky ( Cobie Smulders ) . The lives of all characters are entwined in each others . The series explores many storylines , including a `` will they or wo n't they '' relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends , Marshall and Lily 's relationship , and the ups and downs of the characters ' careers .   The show 's frame story depicts Ted ( voice of Bob Saget , uncredited ) verbally retelling the story to his son Luke ( David Henrie ) and daughter Penny ( Lyndsy Fonseca ) as they sit on the couch in the year 2030 . This future - set frame is officially the show 's `` present day '' and How I Met Your Mother exploits this framing device in numerous ways : to depict and re-depict events from multiple points of view ; to set up jokes using quick and sometimes multiple flashbacks nested within the oral retelling ; to substitute visual , verbal or aural euphemisms for activities Ted does not want to talk about with his children ( sexual practices , use of illicit substances , vulgar language , etc . ) ; and even to add some elements of humor : in the episode `` How I Met Everyone Else '' , Ted describes his dates with a girlfriend whose name he has forgotten , leading all characters to act as though her given name were `` Blah - Blah '' ; later in the series , Ted remembers her name as Carol .   While the traditional love - story structure begins when the romantic leads first encounter each other , How I Met Your Mother does not introduce Ted 's wife ( Cristin Milioti ) until the eighth - season finale , and only announces her name ( Tracy McConnell ) during the series finale . The show instead focuses on Ted 's prior relationships and his dissatisfaction with those women , thus setting the stage for his eventual happiness with Tracy . Finally in present 2030 , six years after Tracy 's death , Ted gets back with Robin .   Production ( edit )   How I Met Your Mother was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas ' idea to `` write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York '' , where they previously worked as writers for Late Show with David Letterman , among others . The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters . Ted is based loosely on Bays , and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife . Thomas ' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her . Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available . Josh Radnor and Jason Segel , who were cast as Ted and Marshall , respectively , were not well known , though Segel had been a cast member on the short - lived Freaks and Geeks and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow follow - up Undeclared . The role of Barney was initially envisioned as a `` John Belushi - type character '' before Neil Patrick Harris won the role after being invited to an audition by the show 's casting director Megan Branman . Pamela Fryman invited Bob Saget to be the voiceover narrator , Future Ted , explaining to him that the show would be like The Wonder Years but `` kind of into the future '' . Saget either went to the television studio and recorded the narration while watching the episode , or did so separately and rerecorded with the episode if necessary . He normally did not attend table readings but did so for the last episode .   In various interviews Bays and Thomas have stated that `` a pretty famous actress '' turned down the role of Robin , whom they revealed in February 2014 to have been Jennifer Love Hewitt . They then cast Cobie Smulders for the role who , at the time , was fairly unknown . Bays and Thomas later said , `` Thank God we did for a million reasons ... when Ted 's seeing her for the first time , America 's seeing her for the first time -- the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive '' . Although Ted is initially smitten by Robin in the pilot , it is quickly established at the end of the episode that she is not the mother , which Thomas said was done so they would not copy or rehash the `` will they or wo n't they '' Ross and Rachel storyline from Friends .   According to an Entertainment Weekly article , the writers adopted facets of each main actor 's personality and incorporated them into their characters . This includes Neil Patrick Harris ' skills with magic , Jason Segel 's passion for songwriting , Alyson Hannigan 's absent - mindedness while pregnant , and Josh Radnor 's intellectualism .   MacLaren 's , an Irish bar in the middle of New York , in which some of the show is set , is loosely based on four favorite bars of Bays , Thomas and others from the Late Show staff . They include : McGee 's , a Midtown tavern near the Ed Sullivan Theater where the Late Show is taped ; McHale 's , a legendary Hell 's Kitchen bar which closed in 2006 ; Chumley 's , a since - closed historic Greenwich Village pub ; and Fez , another closed bar on the Upper West Side . McGee 's had a mural that Bays and Thomas both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show . The name for the bar is from Carter Bays ' assistant , Carl MacLaren ; the bartender in the show is also named Carl .   Episodes were generally shot over a three - day period in the Los Angeles - based Soundstage Studio 22 and featured upwards of 50 scenes with quick transitions and flashbacks . However , the `` Pilot '' episode was filmed at CBS Radford . The laugh track was later created by recording an audience being shown the final edited episode . Thomas claimed that shooting before a live audience would have been impossible because of the structure of the show and the numerous flashforwards in each episode and because doing so `` would blur the line between ' audience ' and ' hostage situation ' '' . Later seasons started filming in front of an audience on occasion when smaller sets were used .   The theme song is a portion of `` Hey Beautiful '' by The Solids , of which Bays and Thomas are members . Episodes from Season 1 generally started with the opening credits . A cold opening has been used since Season 2 . Viewers then occasionally see Ted 's children on a couch and hear him talking to them , telling the story of how he met their mother . Alternatively , scenes from previous episodes or shots of New York City with Ted narrating over the top are shown . Thomas has stated that Future Ted is an unreliable narrator since he is trying to tell a story that happened over 20 years earlier ; this has been a plot point in several episodes including `` The Goat '' , `` Oh Honey '' , `` How I Met Everyone Else '' and `` The Mermaid Theory '' . Nevertheless , Thomas has also emphasized maintaining a coherent and consistent universe and trying to avoid continuity errors , a problem he noticed in other shows .   A scene relating to the identity of the mother , involving Ted 's future children , was filmed in 2006 for the show 's eventual series finale . This was done because the teenage actors portraying them would be adults by the time the final season was shot .   During the 2007 -- 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , How I Met Your Mother shut - down production ; when the strike ended , the show returned on March 17 , 2008 , with nine new episodes . The network announced a change in the timeslot to 8 : 30 pm ET / 7 : 30 pm CT , flip - flopping from the summer schedule with The Big Bang Theory . CBS renewed the show for a fourth season on May 14 , 2008 , which premiered on September 22 , 2008 .   In September 2008 , Lifetime Television announced it had purchased the cable rerun rights to How I Met Your Mother at a rate of about $725,000 per episode . The four - year syndication contract stipulated that the studio deliver at least 110 half - hour episodes by the year 2010 , and allowed for up to eight seasons of the show . At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced , and a further 22 episodes were required , ensuring that there would be a fifth season . There also was a complication with the writing of the show due to the absence of actress Alyson Hannigan due to her pregnancy . The writers had to create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters . On May 19 , 2009 , the fifth - season renewal was announced . May 20 , 2009 , CBS announced that How I Met Your Mother would again be aired at 8 pm , leading into the new comedy Accidentally on Purpose . On January 12 , 2010 , the show aired its 100th episode and CBS announced that the series would return for a sixth season . Upon learning that the series would be syndicated , Thomas said , `` We 're thrilled that it will live on in other forms , '' and they were proud of the show and it was great to see the strong demand .   Reruns of the series began airing on local U.S. broadcast television stations and on Chicago - based cable superstation WGN America September 13 , 2010 . Featured in these airings are vanity cards previously unseen in the CBS and Lifetime airings due to marginalized credit sequences used by the two networks . Shown in between the closing credits and the production company credits , these vanity cards show portions of `` The Bro Code '' , a list of rules frequently referenced by Harris ' character , Barney Stinson , on how men should interact with each other , with an emphasis on activities involving pursuing members of the opposite sex . The opening theme song for the syndicated reruns is also slightly edited , running shorter and not using all the pictures seen in the opening montage that runs on DVD and the original CBS broadcasts . The episodes are also slightly edited , leaving out a few details .   One of the series ' ongoing traditions involves giving guest roles to actors from various Joss Whedon productions , many of whom co-starred with Hannigan on Buffy the Vampire Slayer . Bays attributes this to their being `` huge fans '' and to those casts representing `` a big talent pool '' .   On March 4 , 2011 , CBS announced that the show had been renewed for two more seasons , with the seventh season premiering with back - to - back episodes on September 19 , 2011 .   On July 27 , 2011 , the FX channel announced it had picked up the series for syndication . On September 5 , 2011 , FX began airing the series .   Although cast members had previously stated that the show would not run longer than eight seasons , a ninth season was secured in December 2012 amidst tense negotiations with the studios and the actors -- especially Jason Segel , who had wanted to move on to other ventures after the eighth season . During these negotiations , Bays and Thomas originally approached the eighth season as if it was the show 's last year , but also had a `` Plan B '' if the show was renewed . After producers secured a ninth and final season , they implemented plans to secretly cast the titular future mother , with Cristin Milioti eventually winning the role , besting at least two other contenders . Milioti first appeared in the last scene in the season eight finale `` Something New '' and was a regular cast member in the show 's final season . This marked the first time that the show had expanded its core roster .   In January 2013 , How I Met Your Mother was renewed for a ninth and final season . Carter Bays stated to Entertainment Weekly that season nine `` will feature some of the most non-linear episodes we 've ever done '' .   The season nine premiere episode aired on September 23 , 2013 and the one - hour series finale aired on March 31 , 2014 .

Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate , much to the disgust of his self - appointed best friend Barney Stinson ( Neil Patrick Harris ) , whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier . Barney is a serial womanizer who concocts elaborate con games , usually involving costumes and fake identities , designed to bed women , only to lose interest in them immediately afterward .   Ted begins his search for his perfect soul mate and meets an ambitious young reporter from Canada , Robin Scherbatsky ( Cobie Smulders ) , with whom he quickly falls in love . Robin , however , does not want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends . Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as `` Aunt Robin '' .

He uses one slap immediately and another later in the season . It is revealed that Barney has a gay African American half - brother named James ( Wayne Brady ) and , unaware that his mother lied to him , believes that Bob Barker is his father .

While on the show , Barney wins all the prizes and gives them to Lily and Marshall as a ' happy early wedding ' present .   In the season finale , Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage and children . They did not tell anyone , in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall 's wedding .

Barney is slapped for the third time on Thanksgiving , which Marshall dubs `` Slapsgiving . ''   Ted tells his children he met their mother through a story concerning her yellow umbrella . He finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party where his future wife was , although they did not meet . Ted attempts to woo Stella ( Sarah Chalke ) , a dermatologist he sees to remove an embarrassing butterfly tattoo .

Robin sleeps with Barney after he comforts her following a break - up with a past Canadian love ; Ted is infuriated , and decides to stop being friends with Barney . Meanwhile , an unknown woman begins to sabotage Barney 's attempts to hook up .

Robin and Ted end up talking about it , causing their friendship to begin moving toward a positive note . After Barney finally sleeps with his 200th woman ( and rubs it in the face of the childhood bully who taunted him into pursuing it ) , he begins to question the purpose of the remainder of his life , leaving him more certain of his feelings for Robin .   Ted , while carrying the yellow umbrella , bumps into Stella and Tony . Tony later decides to visit him , sympathizing with Ted over his loss of Stella .

Critical reception ( edit )   The first season was met with generally favorable reviews from critics , though some compared the series unfavorably to Friends . On Metacritic , a review aggregation site that collected 25 reviews for the series , it scored a 69 out of 100 . Michael Abernethy of PopMatters gave the season a negative review , writing that `` The comedy that does occur in How I Met Your Mother is n't enough to compensate for its inconsistencies . '' Tom Shales of The Washington Post gave the season a lukewarm review , saying it 's `` a little better than most other sitcoms , past and present -- especially those featuring wacky urban friends in their twenties experiencing the bittersweet mysteries of life . '' On the other hand , Melanie Macfarlane gave the season a positive review , saying the show `` may not break any comedic ground , but it 's the sort of comfortable , reliable hitter CBS needs on Monday nights . ''   The second season received critical acclaim . Staci Krause of IGN gave the season a positive review , calling it `` great '' .   The third season was met with mostly positive reviews . Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave the season a positive review , saying that `` the season was fun and clever , a good , consistent flow from the first two seasons '' .   The fourth season received critical acclaim and is generally considered the best season of the series . Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave Season 4 an overall rating of 8.5 out of 10 , stating that `` This fourth season seemed to settle down the chase for the titular mother . While Ted was busy dating Stella , the gang settled into many stand alone episodes which were every bit as entertaining as episodes devoted to Ted 's love life '' . Zoromski went on to say : `` A stellar Robin - Marshall episode , titled ' Little Minnesota ' , makes it clear that these two do not get enough screen time together . With Robin homesick and unemployed ( and at risk of being deported ) , this pairing brought out the best Robin Sparkles reference of the season , when Marshall leads a rousing karaoke version of ' Let 's Go to the Mall ! ' ''   The fifth season received mostly positive reviews . Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity gave the season a mixed review , and at the end of the season wrote : `` I 'm okay with any given season not being primarily focused on mother - meeting , but this season , the characters seemed to regress -- particularly Barney and Ted . Usually , when a season ends , I have to deal with a week or two weeks ' worth of letdown . Right now , all I 'm feeling is relief . ''   The sixth season received generally positive reviews . Justin Fowler of Later Reviews gave the season a positive review , saying that the season was `` a pretty good season of television '' and better than the `` poor '' fifth season . He also said that `` Seventeen out of the 24 episodes are what I would consider good '' .   The seventh season received mixed reviews . Alan Sepinwall gave the season a mixed review and criticized the flash - forwards throughout the season , saying that `` the show is just much , much stronger when its stories dwell on matters of the present or the past , and where the writers do n't have to act like magicians trying to keep the audience from figuring out how the trick works . And the finale affirmed that belief for me . The parts that had little or nothing to do with things to come were quite good ; the parts that were all about the future made me roll my eyes and ask , for the umpteenth time , ' Really ? This is where you 're going with this ? ' ''   The eighth season was widely criticized , with Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 40 % of critics gave the show a positive review . The consensus reads : `` How I Met Your Mother wears out its welcome this season , with an anticlimactic reveal and rote , less - than - fruitful humor . ''   The ninth season received mixed to positive reviews by critics , though fans found it worse than prior seasons . Rotten Tomatoes reported that 80 % of critics gave the show a positive review , with an average rating of 7.3 out of 10 . Gareth Mitchell at `` House of Geekery '' responded negatively , mostly criticizing the structure of the season , stating that they are `` struggling to come up with stories that last out the 22 minutes '' . The finale of the show received a polarized reaction from fans . While some complained that the last few seasons had built towards an end game that was discarded within the hour - long episode , others felt that it remained true to both the initial concept of the show and to life itself .   Tie - ins ( edit )   Books ( edit )    The Bro Code , cited by Barney many times throughout the series , is a set of written rules for bros to follow , and has been published as a tie - in novel , an audiobook , an iPhone Application and an Android Application . Barney alleges it was written by Barnabus Stinson , a contemporary of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin . Many of the rules listed in this book also appear in the show 's closing vanity cards in syndication .   Bro on the Go , a companion to The Bro Code , released in 2009 .   Bro Code for Parents : What to Expect When You 're Awesome , released in 2012 .   The Playbook , based on the fifth season episode of the same name , by Barney Stinson and Matt Kuhn .

Pineapple Incident explained ( edit )   After the end of the series , the officials released a short video , explaining the running mystery of the pineapple in the Pineapple Incident ( season 1 , episode 10 ) . The extra footage revealed that a character revealed in the 6th season , the Captain , had put a pineapple in front of his door as a tradition and Ted took the pineapple while he was drunk .   Proposed spin - offs ( edit )  How I Met Your Dad ( edit )  On November 15 , 2013 , it was announced that CBS and the series ' producer 20th Century Fox Television would launch How I Met Your Dad , a woman - centric variation executive - produced by Bays , Thomas , and Emily Spivey .

Nina Tassler , the entertainment president at CBS , stated that `` there were elements of the pilot that did n't work out '' . Talks of the series being `` shopped '' to other networks emerged . Netflix , FOX and NBC were named as possible candidates for picking up the show .   Ultimately , nothing came of those talks . It was reported that the options on the cast contracts had expired and they had been released from their contracts and co-creator Carter Bays denied any rumours that the spin - off pilot will be reshot . On July 11 , 2014 , Bays confirmed that the spin - off project was officially dead . Six days later , Nina Tassler said that CBS would `` love the opportunity to take another shot '' at the pilot and that she would continue to `` hound '' Carter Bays and Craig Thomas -- even though they shot down the idea of a new version of the project stating that they had both moved on .  How I Met Your father ( first attempt ) ( edit )  On December 14 , 2016 , it was reported that Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger were set to write a new version of the previous spin - off 's pilot , re-titled How I Met Your Father , with Bays and Thomas serving as executive producers . On March 6 , 2017 , it was announced that following signing new contracts with 20th Century Fox Television that would see both Aptaker and Berger being promoted to executive producers and co-showrunners on This Is Us alongside Dan Fogelman , their completed spec script for How I Met Your Father would be placed on the back burner in light of their new duties . The idea was later completely abandoned .  How I Met Your father ( second attempt ) ( edit )  On August 8 , 2017 , Fox chairman Dana Walden told Deadline that the studio was set to try a third spin - off with different writers . It was also stated that all ideas from the previous two attempts will not be carried over and the new attempt will be created from scratch .

The show was renewed for the final season on December 21 , 2012 , after cast member Jason Segel changed his decision to leave the show after Season 8 . Cristin Milioti , who was revealed as `` The Mother '' in the Season 8 finale , was promoted to a series regular , the only time How I Met Your Mother added a new regular cast member . Season 9 consists of 24 episodes , each running approximately 22 minutes in length .   Taking place immediately after where the previous season left off , Season 9 covers the events of a single weekend that lead up to Barney ( Neil Patrick Harris ) and Robin 's ( Cobie Smulders ) wedding . During the course of the weekend , `` The Mother '' ( Milioti ) is separately introduced to Robin , Barney , Lily ( Alyson Hannigan ) , and Marshall ( Jason Segel ) , before finally meeting Ted ( Josh Radnor ) . The season also features frequent flashbacks and flashforwards in order to fully integrate The Mother 's character with the rest of the cast . Thomas said in an interview that Season 9 is like `` the Wild West -- anything can happen '' .   In February 2013 , Bays and Thomas teased that Season 9 is `` going to be a new way to tell the story '' . The initial reaction to the new storytelling structure of Season 9 was mixed . Ethan Anderton from Screen Rant was concerned about how `` 24 episodes of television are going to be crafted from just three days of time '' , and Alan Sepinwall of HitFix was exasperated that after eight seasons , `` They are really going to stretch Robin and Barney 's wedding weekend out over the entire final season '' , though he expressed more optimism after the San Diego Comic - Con panel for the final season .

Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , and Alyson Hannigan all reprise their roles in this season . Cristin Milioti , who was revealed as The Mother in the Season 8 finale , has been promoted to series regular , a first for the series .   How I Met Your Mother was initially scheduled to run for eight seasons after CBS ordered a seventh and eighth season in 2011 . The show gained a resurgence in ratings during season seven , and CBS began discussing the possibility of ordering a ninth season . By 2012 , Deadline.com reported that CBS , 20th Century Fox , and all regular cast members except Segel wanted to continue with a ninth season . Segel had initially wanted to focus on his film career , leaving the fate of a ninth season uncertain . Co-creator Carter Bays observed that the negotiations were stressful , with a lot of `` white - knuckled , nail - biting going on '' , but claimed that he was `` confident that everything would work out '' . Craig Thomas noted the flexibility of the show 's filming schedule , saying : `` We 've always done everything humanly possible to allow ( the actors ) to do other things . '' Segel ultimately decided to sign on for the final season , and Season 9 was announced on December 21 , 2012 . Thomas and Bays were relieved that a deal had been reached for another season , fearing that having to wrap up the show in Season 8 would have `` felt rushed '' and been `` disappointing '' .  It was a pretty big umbrella to fill , and yet Cristin ( Milioti ) is , against all odds , exactly what we were looking for . She made us laugh on 30 Rock , she made us swoon in Once , and her ukulele skills are no joke . We 're thrilled to welcome her to the How I Met Your Mother family , and look forward to getting to know her -- and the character she plays -- much better in the coming final season . -- Carter Bays  Bays and Thomas were first introduced to Milioti as a possibility for playing The Mother through casting director Marisa Ross . Narrowing down the candidates to three actresses early on allowed the casting department to avoid a publicized casting call for The Mother . Milioti was flown into Los Angeles to do an on - camera `` chemistry test '' with Radnor as part of her audition . Harris , who is a Broadway fan and had recognized her in the makeup trailer , gave Milioti a hug and exclaimed `` You 're The Mother ! '' before she was actually cast . Milioti was chosen partly because her musical history and time on Broadway , including her performance in Once , would have allowed her to play the role of The Mother , a musician , more convincingly . Bays and Thomas wanted to avoid casting someone who was well - known , fearing that the audiences ' preconceptions of a famous actress might spill into her performance in the role . Milioti 's casting was well received by critics , many of whom lauded the show for resisting the urge to cast a familiar face and instead opting for a relative unknown . Bill Kuchman from TV.com observed that , because `` Milioti is a blank canvas to many of us '' , she has the `` freedom to create a How I Met Your Mother character that 's free of the burden of being compared to her past work '' .   When asked at Comic - Con about guest stars , Bays revealed that , `` If there 's someone we loved over the course of the series , there 's a good chance they 're coming back ( for the final season ) . '' Returning guest stars include Wayne Brady and John Lithgow as Barney 's brother and father , respectively , and Ellen D. Williams as Robin 's co-worker Patrice .   Also reprising their roles as Ted 's teenage daughter and son in `` The Year 2030 '' are Lyndsy Fonseca and David Henrie . For the bulk of the series ' run , stock footage of a younger Fonseca and Henrie from the series ' first season have been used , the better to reflect the kids not aging while hearing their father tell his story . The kids ' scenes included one key moment filmed before production on Season 2 began ; that scene , according to Bays and Thomas , served as the climax to Ted 's story of how he and the kids ' mother met . The climax was filmed on a set closed to everyone except Bays , Thomas , a camera operator , and Fonseca and Henrie , who signed non-disclosure agreements . Fonseca states she had forgotten the details of the scene in the years since its filming , while Henrie states , `` I do remember . I think I remember . We 'll see .

The panel released a teaser trailer featuring Ted 's children as adults , still listening to Ted tell his story eight years from when he first began . Angry at having spent years listening , they insist Ted finish his story so they can leave . The panel answered questions from fans as well as releasing select plot spoilers planned for the season .   Bays was enthusiastic about the trajectory of the season , saying that `` we 've never been in a place where it 's July and we 've plotted out the entire season , but we have this year because there 's so much exciting stuff '' .   Distribution ( edit )   Season 9 premiered on CBS on September 23 , 2013 , with two 22 - minute episodes , and contained 24 episodes .   Reception ( edit )   The ninth season of How I Met Your Mother received mostly positive reviews from critics . The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave an 80 % approval rating for the season with an average rating of 7.3 / 10 , based on 10 reviews . At the end of the season , Max Nicholson of IGN gave the season a negative review , writing : `` Many How I Met Your Mother fans felt betrayed after watching the series finale -- and understandably so after Season 9 spent 22 of its 24 episodes building towards a wedding that was basically meaningless . In retrospect , almost any other arc would have made a better foundation for Season 9 , including the series finale . In the end , unbalanced storytelling , lack of focus and unfunny detours led to the show 's eventual downfall . '' Adam Vitcavage of Paste Magazine gave the season a lukewarm review , saying that `` Nothing was over-the - top funny , but it was a perfect combination of laughter and sweet moments that really do make up for all of the lackluster episodes in the past few seasons .

( November 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )      From left to right : Ted , Robin , Barney , Marshall , Lily .  The American sitcom How I Met Your Mother premiered on CBS on September 19 , 2005 . Created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays , the show is presented from the perspective of Ted Mosby in 2030 ( `` Future Ted '' ) as he tells his children how he met the titular mother . The show lasted for nine seasons and 208 episodes ; the finale first aired on March 31 , 2014 .   The main characters are : Ted , a romantic searching for `` The One '' ; Barney Stinson , a womanizer ; Robin Scherbatsky , a journalist who moved to New York in 2005 ; and Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin , a long - term couple . Although the show is based around The Mother , her first appearance is not until the season - eight finale .   Many of the main character 's relatives appear throughout the show , such as Lily 's father or Barney 's brother . They may also be seen in family gatherings , such as Barney and Robin 's wedding or Marshall 's father 's funeral . Ted 's children and Marvin W. Eriksen ( son of Marshall and Lily ) appear in the background of many episodes without being crucial to many plots .   Ranjit , Carl the Bartender , and several other characters often appear because they work in places the main cast frequent ( such as MacLaren 's Pub ) . Characters in relationships with Ted , Barney , or Robin often appear in several episodes within a short period of time , such as Victoria , Nora , or Kevin . Minor characters such as the Slutty Pumpkin or Mary the Paralegal may only appear in one or two episodes , but still play a crucial role in the episodes in which they appear .

Marshall eventually is accepted to his dream job , being a judge , after committing to move to Italy with Lily . This leads to constant strife between the couple through most of the final season . However , throughout the first half of the last season , Marshall is on a car ride from Minnesota to Long Island after missing his flight to Barney and Robin 's wedding . In this process , Marshall meets The Mother .   The Mother ( Tracy mcconnell ) ( edit )  Main article : The Mother ( How I Met Your Mother ) Cristin Milioti   Appears in eight episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character , appears in 14 episodes from `` Something New '' to `` Last Forever ''    Portrayed by Cristin Milioti , the Mother is the title character of the series ; Ted 's narration of the series is based around how he met her . While several clues about the Mother are revealed throughout the series ( including the story of the yellow umbrella ) , she is not fully seen until the season - eight finale , `` Something New '' . Season 9 reveals more about the Mother through several flashforwards throughout the season and the 200th episode , `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , which shows the years 2005 through 2013 from her perspective . In that episode , it is revealed that her boyfriend Max died on her 21st birthday and that she refrained from dating in the years following ; her first boyfriend after Max , Louis , proposed to her the night before Barney and Robin 's wedding , but she rejected , allowing herself to move on . It is the highest rated episode of the series on IMDb .   Ted is shown meeting The Mother in the series finale at the Farhampton train station following Barney and Robin 's wedding . They date , get engaged , and have two children called Luke and Penny . In the original ending of the show , The Mother is shown to have been deceased in 2024 . Many fans of the show had become emotionally attached to The Mother . In many scenes throughout the show , it was shown how incredibly perfect Ted and Tracy were for each other and how nice she was to everyone . Her death in the series finale was met with considerable dissatisfaction by many viewers .   A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition received over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby .

Both Penny and Luke appear as young children in `` Rally '' , when they greet their parents on New Year 's Day in 2022 .   Since the actors playing Ted 's children were going to age quickly , stock footage of them was shot in 2006 , to be used in later episodes . Additionally , footage for the series finale was shot and the actors were made to sign non-disclosure agreements ; Fonseca said in 2013 that she did not `` remember what the secret was '' , although Henrie thought he remembered .

Marvin has been played by twins , and several actors have been credited as playing him ; Jake Elliott , August Maturo and Spencer Ralston have played the part of Marvin during various flashforwards .

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise . ( December 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )      Part 1    In a flashback to September 2005 , Ted ( Josh Radnor ) , Marshall ( Jason Segel ) , Lily ( Alyson Hannigan ) and Barney ( Neil Patrick Harris ) accept Robin ( Cobie Smulders ) into their group . Lily , optimistic about Robin 's friendship , decrees that Ted and Barney can not hook up with her unless they marry her , and Barney scoffs at the idea .   In May 2013 , Ted discusses his move to Chicago with Marshall and Lily at Barney and Robin 's wedding reception . Meanwhile , Barney recognizes the bass player as the woman -- already introduced in previous episodes as the Mother ( Cristin Milioti ) -- who advised him to pursue Robin . When he hears she 's single , he suddenly realises what this means , and approaches Ted with the intent to introduce her to him , who declines the idea as he has to leave in order to get ready to move the next day . Outside , the group sadly bids Ted farewell , and he does a final high - five with Barney . Later , Ted goes to the Farhampton train station ; however , his train is late . He tells an elderly lady about his weekend and she asks many questions about destiny . She looks up and spots the Mother standing nearby , but Ted insists he ca n't talk to her because he 's moving . The next night , Marshall and Lily are surprised to see Ted sitting at their table in MacLaren 's . Ted justifies this by telling them that he met a girl , which they approve after finding out she is the bass player from the wedding . At first , Marshall thinks it is crazy , but Lily assures him , saying she thinks its meant to be .   In 2015 , Ted , now engaged , meets Robin and Barney at MacLaren 's to discuss wedding ideas . As Robin goes to buy drinks , Barney admits their marriage is suffering because of Robin 's rising career , which requires her to travel frequently . The Mother arrives and tells Ted they have to delay their wedding because she is pregnant .   In May 2016 , Ted and the Mother host a get - together with the rest of the gang . Marshall is miserable at his new job , having been forced to return to being a corporate lawyer . Barney and Robin reveal that her constant traveling for work put a strain on them , and after three years of marriage , they have divorced . The mood turns positive when Barney realizes that Marshall and Lily are expecting their third child , but Lily is worried about the group breaking apart . Together they promise they will all be there for the big moments and will remain friends . In October 2016 , Marshall and Lily decide to move out of their old apartment and put together a final Halloween roof party . Robin is sad to see Ted and the Mother with matching `` hanging chad '' outfits , alongside Barney who has returned to his womanizing ways . She decides to leave and confesses to Lily that she ca n't be in the group any longer as she has outgrown them and still has unresolved feelings for Ted , which devastates Lily .    Part 2    In 2018 , Barney gets ready for another `` legendary '' night at MacLaren 's , even though Ted and Lily , both being parents , are n't intending to stay out late . Marshall arrives and announces he is replacing a retiring judge in Queens , which prompts a celebration . Later , when Barney attempts to score with a young woman , Lily blasts him for fully regressing into his previous self . Barney defends his behavior by telling her that he knows if he could n't make a marriage with Robin work , he 'll never make it work with anyone . Lily relents and Barney leaves to enjoy his night .   In 2019 , Ted , the Mother , Marshall and Lily are at Robots Versus Wrestlers . A depressed Barney shows up to say that while he recently completed a `` perfect month '' using a new Playbook , the last woman , No. 31 , is pregnant with his child . Later , Ted runs into Robin , now a famous news reporter , while showing Penny the GNB building he designed . Later , Marshall , Lily , and Ted await the birth of Barney 's child . After throwing up in the bathroom , Barney is led in to meet his daughter , Ellie . Despite his initial misgivings , Barney is moved to tears .   At Ted and the Mother 's house , Ted re-proposes to the Mother because it has been five years since they got engaged , and says they are getting married the following Thursday . Before the wedding , the gang meets up at MacLaren 's , and Marshall announces he is running for the New York State Supreme Court . Barney sees two young women at the bar and approaches them . Lily assumes he will hit on them , but instead sees him scold them for dressing inappropriately , sending them home in a fatherly manner . Lily is genuinely surprised , and even more so when Robin shows up to attend . While reconciling with the gang , Robin admits to Ted that after initially declining to come , the Mother told her to reconsider . Marshall pays Lily on their bet that Ted and Robin do n't end up together . Lily gives a toast praising Ted for all he has been through , and Future Ted narrates how he never stopped loving the Mother for a second , even when she became terminally ill and died in 2024 .   Returning the story to May 2013 , Ted gets the courage to introduce himself to the bass player , and she invites him underneath her yellow umbrella . The two engage in a conversation where she tells Ted she remembers him from when he accidentally taught her Economics class on his first day as a professor . Ted realizes that her umbrella is his umbrella that he left at Cindy 's and has his initials on it , but she tells him that T.M. are her initials : Tracy McConnell . Ted continues his conversation with Tracy as the train arrives .   In 2030 , Future Ted finishes his story by saying , `` And that , kids , is how I met your mother . '' Penny and Luke protest that this was not the point of the story , and deduce that it was actually about how he still has feelings for their `` Aunt '' Robin . Ted brushes this off , but his kids remind him that they love Robin and that there 's still a connection between the two of them whenever she visits . They give Ted their blessings to continue his relationship with her . Initially , Ted calls her but instead , decides to go to her apartment with the blue French horn , presenting it the same way he had 25 years earlier . Robin , who is revealed to be living alone with several dogs , seems moved , and they both smile at each other .   Production ( edit )   Before writing the episode , Carter Bays and Craig Thomas decided to watch the series finales of other sitcoms for inspiration . They said that they crafted the last ten minutes of the series right from the start . In February 2014 , Bays tweeted that he found a rough draft of the series finale that he first wrote in 2006 .   The scene involving Ted 's future children ( Lyndsy Fonseca and David Henrie ) was secretly shot in 2006 during the production of Season 2 . This was primarily done so the teenage characters would not age , since Fonseca and Henrie were adults by the time the final episode aired . The scene was filmed on a set closed to everyone except Bays , Thomas , executive producer / director Pamela Fryman , a camera operator , and Fonseca and Henrie , who signed non-disclosure agreements . Fonseca stated that she had forgotten the details of the scene in the years since its filming , while Henrie said , `` I do remember . I think I remember . We 'll see . '' Josh Radnor was also told some parts of the finale from the start , but neither he nor the rest of the cast were informed how the series would end . Radnor , not Bob Saget , plays future Ted when he appears on camera . When asked whether he should have played the role , Saget said that Radnor doing so `` felt appropriate to me . It 's not The Matrix , it 's where Ted CGI 's into a narrator of his voice that was done as a sweet way to tell his story from almost his conscience from the future of his own life '' .   Before the airing of the series finale , debates raged amongst fans concerning the fate of Ted and the Mother , fueled by scenes from `` Vesuvius '' and other previous episodes that seemed to point to a tragic ending .   According to tweets from Alyson Hannigan , approximately 18 minutes of the original episode had to be cut to fit the broadcast time . One cut sequence features Lily paying back Marshall regarding a bet on whether Ted and Robin end up together , first referenced in the episode `` No Pressure '' . Other cut scenes feature Robin , wearing her Robin Sparkles jeans jacket over her wedding dress , singing `` Let 's Go to The Mall '' with the Mother 's band at the wedding reception , and a `` one - second '' montage showing Tracy 's funeral .   An alternate cut of the ending , appeared on the season nine DVD and the box set . It did not contain any new footage , but is edited in a way that changes the fates of Ted , Tracy and Robin . The voiceover is performed by Saget , rather than Radnor , and is completely different .   Everything but the Girl 's acoustic cover of the Tom Waits song `` Downtown Train '' was used in the scene where Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station . Music supervisor Andy Gowan says that Carter Bays `` basically put it in the script , and wrote that script with that song in mind '' ; Gowan described the song as `` heartbreakingly beautiful '' and captured both the `` sweet and romantic '' and the `` somber , dark part '' of the scene .   `` Heaven '' by The Walkmen features in the final scene of `` Last Forever '' . Gowan said that `` it seemed like it was written for our show '' . Gowan had suggested the song before , especially for use in the season 8 premiere , and said that when he pitched it for use in the season 9 finale , `` ( the song ) was just the one that resonated with all of us the most '' .   Critical reception ( edit )   `` Last Forever '' received a polarizing reaction from fans and critics alike , with the majority opinion being negative . Many viewers expressed considerable dissatisfaction regarding the resolution of Ted 's story , his relationship to Robin , and the fate of the titular mother . Additionally , the season - long buildup for Barney and Robin 's wedding and their divorce 10 minutes into the next episode was criticized . Fans took to social media , such as Tumblr and Twitter , to express their disappointment . Some fans joked that the episode was an early April Fools ' joke , because it aired on March 31 .   Some fans of the show called on CBS to commission the creators of the show via a change.org petition to rewrite and reshoot the finale . As of April 2 , 2014 , the petition had received more than 5,000 signatures . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending , from the same filmed material , would be included on the Season 9 DVD .   Bill Kuchman of Popculturology said that the success of Milioti as the Mother made it hard to write the character away so quickly , saying , `` Thanks to the show 's writing staff and Cristin Milioti , HIMYM had a huge victory on its hands with The Mother . Asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request . '' Kuchman noted that `` ( over ) the course of this final season , HIMYM made us care about Tracy . It made us believe that she and Ted belonged together . It was earned . That 's why it was sad to see HIMYM just brush Tracy away . ''   Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B+ , saying , `` The hour finale was a strange ride , marvelous in some ways , confounding in others . Endings are difficult , and I do n't think any objective assessment would say they nailed this one . '' Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was more blunt in saying that `` Bays and Thomas simply looked like shitty long - term planners , unable to understand that getting the audience so invested in the Barney and Robin coupling or in Tracy as a character would make it all the harder when the series finale abruptly dissolved the former and treated the latter 's death as an aside in the narration . That the show never seemed to suggest Ted mourned her feels like a vital betrayal of his character . ''   Alan Sepinwall of HitFix cited three reasons why Bays and Thomas should not have stuck with the ending they had originally envisioned at the start : the show 's lengthy run forced them to stretch out events like Barney 's and Robin 's wedding , which would have to be quickly undone in the finale ; the chemistry between Cobie Smulders and Neil Patrick Harris caused many fans to become deeply invested in Robin and Barney 's relationship more than Robin and Ted 's ; and the casting of Cristin Milioti as the Mother caused fans to become invested in that character as well . Sepinwall stated that `` so much of what was terrible here was terrible because Bays and Thomas had a very specific vision for the ending of their show and would not -- or , perhaps , after they filmed the kids ' reactions , could not -- deviate from it . And based on the initial reaction I 've seen to the episode , it 's going to forever sour the opinion many fans of the show had for it . ''   Joyce Eng of TV Guide said that she 'd prefer Ted not to have ended up with Robin , but `` as I consider the romantics that co-creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas are , it 's obvious they would bring this long , winding love story full circle back to the person Ted wanted to be with when we met him . And The Mother -- excuse us , Tracy -- is reunited with her first true love , Max , too . '' Though the Mother served as a `` cheap plot device '' to a degree , Eng said that `` Ted 's time with her also taught him nothing lasts forever , nothing 's perfect . And he needs to move on with his life , but that does n't make his relationship with The Mother any less important . I do n't think the Ted of 2005 would 've done the same . ''   Andrew Meola from MStars praised the episode , saying `` I could n't believe that they actually killed the Mother . But I let it sit for a bit , and then I felt something profoundly beautiful come out of this last hour of How I Met Your Mother . ''   In an interview with David Letterman , Neil Patrick Harris declared himself a fan of the way the finale ended the series : `` Some people just hated it , and I think that that 's a compliment to the show in a weird way because it means that they have grown up with these characters and feel like they wanted it to go a certain way , though I think it 's great . But our show really did cross the line between funny funny and really serious , and that was kind of the balance that this show had . And as the show grew up , and as we grew up in the show , it ended in a more adult way and I think it was a nice , reflective , kind of sad , but happy ending to a long , long story .
